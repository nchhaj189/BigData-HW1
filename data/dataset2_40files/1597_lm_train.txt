HA
HA
I SHALL TELL THEE THE NAMES OF THE TWO FLOWERS THOU WOULDST HAVE TORN UP AND THOU WILT SEE THEIR WHOLE FUTURE LIFE--THEIR WHOLE HUMAN EXISTENCE
TIS A CURIOUS WORLD WE LIVE IN CONTINUED HE SOLILOQUIZING
SHE THEN HAD ALL THE LADIES OF THE COURT DRUMMED TOGETHER
COULD I EXCHANGE MY NATURE WITH ANY OTHER CREATURE I FAIN WOULD BE SUCH A HAPPY LITTLE LARK HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THESE HASTY WORDS WHEN THE SKIRTS AND SLEEVES OF HIS COAT FOLDED THEMSELVES TOGETHER INTO WINGS
WOULD SHE TO ME WERE KIND
MAY THE GOOD EVER-LOVING GOD FULFIL YOUR LOVELIEST DREAM LITTLE TUKEY DID NOT AT ALL KNOW WHAT HE HAD DREAMED BUT THE LOVING GOD KNEW IT
THEY GREW HUNGRY AND THIRSTY
THE HIGHER THE POSITION IN WHICH ONE FINDS ONESELF TRANSPLANTED THE GREATER IS THE SUFFERING
AND YET ELECTRICITY IS QUICKER STILL
A DANISH MILE IS NEARLY 4 3/4 ENGLISH
ON ONE BRANCH THERE HUNG LITTLE NETS CUT OUT OF COLORED PAPER AND EACH NET WAS FILLED WITH SUGARPLUMS
NO ONE KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT THEM FOR THEY ARE ALL OF THEM BURIED
AND THAT TOO FOR MANY A YEAR
IT IS NO DOUBT COLD ENOUGH IN YOUR WOODS BUT THERE AT LEAST IS THE BREATH OF LIBERTY
WILL YOU BE MY SHADOW
THE FIRST HEART THROUGH WHICH HE CAME WAS THAT OF A MIDDLE-AGED LADY BUT HE INSTANTLY FANCIED HIMSELF IN THE ROOM OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE CURE OF THE CROOKED AND DEFORMED WHERE CASTS OF MIS-SHAPEN LIMBS ARE DISPLAYED IN NAKED REALITY ON THE WALL
IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF FEAR HE CALLED INDEED AS LOUD AS HE COULD--"YOU IMPUDENT LITTLE BLACKGUARD
ALAS HE SIGHED QUITE SORROWFUL AND GAZED AT THE CHIRPING BIRDS THAT HOPPED CONTENTEDLY FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH THEY ARE MUCH BETTER OFF THAN I
SUDDENLY LITTLE GERDA STEPPED THROUGH THE GREAT PORTAL INTO THE PALACE
ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE DEAD NO ONE TOOK CARE OF IT AND I WAS THEN A LITTLE BOY HOW VERY VERY LONELY HE MUST HAVE BEEN SAID SHE
THE WHOLE PASSAGE WAS HUNG WITH PORTRAITS OF KNIGHTS IN ARMOR AND LADIES IN SILKEN GOWNS
IT WAS A LARGE OIL-SKIN CAP WHICH A SAILOR-BOY OF THE QUAY HAD THROWN OVER THE STRUGGLING BIRD
YOU AS A LEARNED MAN CERTAINLY KNOW HOW STRANGE NATURE IS
IT WAS FROM YOU
ONE OF THE YOUNGEST RAN AND TORE OFF THE GOLDEN STAR
ON WHICH ACCOUNT HIS FOOT VERY NATURALLY SANK IN THE MUD AND PUDDLES OF THE STREET THERE HAVING BEEN IN THOSE DAYS NO PAVEMENT IN COPENHAGEN
IT SEEMED REALLY TO THE LITTLE MAIDEN AS THOUGH SHE WERE SITTING BEFORE A LARGE IRON STOVE WITH BURNISHED BRASS FEET AND A BRASS ORNAMENT AT TOP
AND THERE IN THE CORNER STOOD A WATERPAIL WHERE I USED TO SWIM MY BOATS TRUE
THEY HAD GREAT-GRAND-CHILDREN AND WERE SOON TO CELEBRATE THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR MARRIAGE
NO ONE--NOT EVEN MY SHADOW SAID THE SHADOW AND HE HAD HIS OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT IT
AND THE OLD LADY GAVE THE OLD SOLDIER ALMS AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH WITH KAREN
IT WAS LIKE THE SOUND OF A CHURCH-BELL
SO ONLY THINK HOW THE TREES MUST HAVE SPARKLED IN THE SUNSHINE
IT HAS MY COMPLETE APPROBATION AND HE SMILED MOST GRACIOUSLY AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE EMPTY LOOMS
THE SHOES OF FORTUNE I
IT HAD LOST ALL ITS GILDING IT LOOKED LIKE A PIECE OF WET CLAY BUT IT HAD AN OPINION AND IT GAVE IT
I KNOW HE HAD ON NEW BOOTS
IT WILL DO YOU MUCH GOOD TO TRAVEL
IN THE MOONLIGHT I WAS VERY NEAR BEING MORE DISTINCT THAN YOURSELF
THERE THE SNOW QUEEN HAS HER COUNTRY-HOUSE AND BURNS BLUE LIGHTS EVERY EVENING
THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM WHERE DO YOU COME FROM ASKED THE MICE
IN IT HE LAY IN THE SLEEP OF DEATH
WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED THE HOSTESS PLUCKING THE COUNCILLOR BY THE SLEEVE
TO GIVE FURTHER PROOF OF IT HOWEVER WOULD IN MOST CASES BE INSIPID FOR IT IS A MOST FOOLISH NOTION TO FANCY A POET DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MEN
SEE CRIED THEY AT LAST
SHE SAT AND SEWED TOGETHER AS WELL AS SHE COULD A LITTLE PAIR OF SHOES OUT OF OLD RED STRIPS OF CLOTH
AND THEN AWAY SHE RODE
BUT THE FIR UNDERSTOOD IT NOT
SHE DANCED AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DANCE THROUGH THE GLOOMY NIGHT
THE MATTER OF WHICH IT WAS BUILT WAS JUST AS SOFT AND FORMED SIMILAR TOWERS AND DOMES AND PILLARS TRANSPARENT AND ROCKING IN THE THIN AIR
HE HAD NOT COME TO WOO THE PRINCESS BUT ONLY TO HEAR HER WISDOM
HE WOULD THEREFORE NOT TALK ABOUT IT AT ALL
BUT SHE EXPRESSED MUCH DISSATISFACTION THAT A COMMON FIELD-BIRD AS SHE CALLED THE LARK SHOULD APPEAR IN SUCH HIGH SOCIETY
AND THEREIN YOU MIGHT READ THAT EVERY GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN WAS AT LIBERTY TO COME TO THE PALACE AND SPEAK TO THE PRINCESS
BUT I AM AFRAID WE SHALL HARDLY SUCCEED FOR SHE IS A QUEEN THAT IS NOTHING SAID THE OLD FOLKS
DAME TIGBRITH TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS WHAT IS THAT
I SHALL NOW BE OBLIGED TO ASK THE HAIR-COMB
THEY COULD ALL TALK WELL ENOUGH WHEN THEY WERE OUT IN THE STREET
AS THE DAUGHTER OF A KING SHE NEEDED NOT TO STAND UPON TRIFLES SO SHE SAID YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU CANNOT CAST A SHADOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS MUST BE IMPROVING CONSIDERABLY SAID THE SHADOW I KNOW YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU SEE TOO CLEARLY BUT IT HAS DECREASED YOU ARE CURED
IN OUR TIME WATER HAS WONDERFUL POWERS
YES THEY BLEW--"TRATERATRA
BUT HE NEVER FOUND HIM
THE TAILORS GAVE ME NEW CLOTHES--I AM WELL FURNISHED
HARK TO THE PLAINTIVE SONG OF THE OLD WOMAN TO THE CALL OF THE PRIESTS
THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY
BUT THEY FELL CLOSE TO THE BANK AND THE LITTLE WAVES BORE THEM IMMEDIATELY TO LAND
ALWAYS BUM
THE COURT-LADIES DANCED AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS
AND ONE OF THEM ROSE TOOK OFF HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY AND SAID WITH A SERIOUS COUNTENANCE YOU ARE NO DOUBT A VERY LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR OH NO ANSWERED THE COUNCILLOR I CAN ONLY JOIN IN CONVERSATION ON THIS TOPIC AND ON THAT AS INDEED ONE MUST DO ACCORDING TO THE DEMANDS OF THE WORLD AT PRESENT MODESTIA IS A FINE VIRTUE CONTINUED THE GENTLEMAN
LET US DRINK CLARET AND MEAD AND BREMEN BEER SHOUTED ONE OF THE GUESTS--"AND YOU SHALL DRINK WITH US TWO MAIDENS APPROACHED
LOVELY HALF-NAKED CHILDREN TENDED A HERD OF BLACK SWINE BENEATH A GROUP OF FRAGRANT LAUREL-TREES HARD BY THE ROAD-SIDE
MUCH GOOD THAT WOULD BE THEN SHE WENT TO A CUPBOARD AND DREW OUT A LARGE SKIN ROLLED UP
NOW I WILL GO INTO THE CHURCH THAT PEOPLE MAY SEE ME AND SHE HASTENED TOWARDS THE CHURCH DOOR
AGAIN ALL SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
BUT NO ONE COULD SEE THAT IT WAS A CASK FOR GREEN CLOTH WAS HUNG ALL ROUND IT AND IT STOOD ON A LARGE GAILY-COLORED CARPET
I WAS AT LAST ABOUT TO JUMP DOWN FROM THE DRAWERS
HE FLEW IN
AND IT WAS SUMMER-TIME
YES SAID THE GRANDMOTHER SHE FLIES WHERE THE SWARM HANGS IN THE THICKEST CLUSTERS
IF SO I CAN DO IT
HER GRAND-DAUGHTER THE POOR AND LOVELY SERVANT JUST COME FOR A SHORT VISIT
AND WHEN SHE STEPPED THROUGH THE CHANCEL DOOR ON THE CHURCH PAVEMENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THE OLD FIGURES ON THE TOMBS THOSE PORTRAITS OF OLD PREACHERS AND PREACHERS WIVES WITH STIFF RUFFS AND LONG BLACK DRESSES FIXED THEIR EYES ON HER RED SHOES
HERE IT IS NOT AT ALL AS IT IS OVER THE WAY AT YOUR HOME WHERE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER SPOKE SO PLEASANTLY AND WHERE YOU AND ALL YOUR SWEET CHILDREN MADE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL NOISE
THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD
I WILL NOT HAVE IT
I SHALL PAY THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES NAY THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LEARNED MAN
AND HE WHO SPOKE IN SUCH WISE AS SHOWED HE FELT HIMSELF AT HOME THERE THAT ONE THE PRINCESS WOULD CHOOSE FOR HER HUSBAND
IT WAS METHINKS ABOUT THIS SEASON THAT WE HAD OUR WEDDING YES THIS VERY DAY IS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARRIAGE SAID OLD GRANNY STICKING HER HEAD BETWEEN THE TWO OLD PEOPLE
AND PEOPLE WALKED AND CHURCH-BELLS RANG AND ASSES WENT ALONG WITH A DINGLE-DINGLE-DONG
THORWALDSEN LIVED ALMOST NEXT DOOR TO ME PLUMP
I SAW SAID THE SHADOW WHAT NO HUMAN BEING MUST KNOW BUT WHAT THEY WOULD ALL SO WILLINGLY KNOW--WHAT IS BAD IN THEIR NEIGHBOR
AND THE COUNCILLOR BEFORE WHOSE EYES THE HEROSTRATIC EVENT OF 1801 STILL FLOATED VIVIDLY AGREED ENTIRELY WITH THE OTHERS IN ABUSING THE RASCALLY ENGLISH
THE RAVEN NODDED VERY GRAVELY AND SAID IT MAY BE--IT MAY BE WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK SO CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL
AND NOW IT WORKED MUCH MORE EVIL THAN BEFORE
I AM EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR OF THY GOOD FORTUNE
HE NOW WENT TO FETCH THEM
IT SNOWED AND WAS NEARLY QUITE DARK AND EVENING--THE LAST EVENING OF THE YEAR
YOU MUST NEVER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM
KAY IS DEAD AND GONE SAID SHE TO THE SWALLOWS
IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH THE SHOES HAD POWER OVER THEM
AND THE OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF GOING OUT AT THE DOOR AND HE DID GO
I AM AFRAID THAT HE WILL NEVER RECOVER POOR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS
BUT SO IT IS WHEN ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT COLLECTED
TELL US ABOUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOT ON THE EARTH
THE FLAKES OF SNOW COVERED HER LONG FAIR HAIR WHICH FELL IN BEAUTIFUL CURLS AROUND HER NECK
IF SO YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY SAYING WHAT IT IS NAY IS IT REALLY THOU SAID THE LEARNED MAN
IT IS REALLY TIRESOME THIS ANNOYED HIM
AND THE TREE BEHELD ALL THE BEAUTY OF THE FLOWERS AND THE FRESHNESS IN THE GARDEN
I MEAN THOSE NEW FANGLED NOVELS TWISTING AND WRITHING THEMSELVES IN THE DUST OF COMMONPLACE WHICH ALSO EXPECT TO FIND A READING PUBLIC OH EXCLAIMED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN SMILING THERE IS MUCH WIT IN THEM
GERDA KNEW EVERY FLOWER
FOR THAT WE SHOULD ALL KNOW IN PROPER TIME BUT THE OTHER NEVER
AND THE GREEN GRASS AND LEAVES ABOUT THE BALCONY HUNG QUITE WILD ABOUT THE FALLING BEAMS
AND UNDER IT SAT OF AN AFTERNOON IN THE MOST SPLENDID SUNSHINE TWO OLD PEOPLE
EVERYBODY LOOKED AT HER FEET
BUT HERE WAS WRITTEN
SHE HAD STUCK HERSELF
I DO NOT KNOW MYSELF WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME REJOICE IN OUR PRESENCE SAID THE AIR AND THE SUNLIGHT
THE ANIMAL WAS STRONG AND HANDSOME AND AWAY THEY WENT AT FULL GALLOP ROUND THE LAWN
HE THINKS THAT HE IS A MAN AND THAT I--NOW ONLY THINK--THAT I AM HIS SHADOW IT IS TERRIBLE SAID THE PRINCESS
THE SAME DAY HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL AS PERFECTLY CURED
THIS IS INDEED A TERRIBLE AFFAIR
I CAN SCARCELY BEAR MYSELF ANY LONGER
SO THEN IT HAS ACTUALLY GONE LAST NIGHT AND NOT COME AGAIN
BUT WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME IF I TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHALL DO MORE I HAVE NOTHING TO GIVE SAID THE AFFLICTED MOTHER BUT I WILL GO TO THE WORLD'S END FOR YOU NAY I HAVE NOTHING TO DO THERE SAID THE WOMAN
THEN SHE LAY DOWN TO DRINK UP THE LAKE AND THAT WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR A HUMAN BEING BUT THE AFFLICTED MOTHER THOUGHT THAT A MIRACLE MIGHT HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS
BUT HE HAS NOTHING AT ALL ON AT LAST CRIED OUT ALL THE PEOPLE
BUT HOW DID THE CHILD GET HIS FEET WET THAT IS THE VERY THING THAT NOBODY CAN MAKE OUT SAID HIS MOTHER
AND THERE TOO DID HE OFTEN LAY HIS HEAD DURING THE FLIGHT
ONE LEAF FELL AFTER THE OTHER
THAT I WILL GLADLY GIVE YOU AND SHE GAVE HER HER FINE BLACK HAIR AND GOT THE OLD WOMAN'S SNOW-WHITE HAIR INSTEAD
ON THE TABLE WAS SPREAD A SNOW-WHITE TABLECLOTH
I THINK THAT IT MAY BE LITTLE KAY
A FACULTY WHICH THE OTHERS DO NOT POSSESS
AND THE SOLDIERS PRESENTED ARMS
SHE NODDED TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND
NOT THAT BARREN GRIEF WHICH THE POET MAY ONLY HINT AT BUT NEVER DEPICT IN ITS DETAIL--MISERY AND WANT
WILL YOU BE QUIET SCREAMED THE LADY OF THE HOUSE COVERING THE CAGE WITH AN EMBROIDERED WHITE POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
BUT HE BOASTED
FIRST CAME A DOZEN DRUMMERS WHO UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL HOW TO HANDLE THEIR INSTRUMENTS
YOU WILL BECOME ILL BY IT
GOD BLESS ME
TODAY METHINKS IS A MOST DELICIOUS DAY FOR A POET
SEVENTH STORY
FURTHER IN THERE WAS HEARD THE SOUND OF MUSIC
AND WHICH MAY VERY POSSIBLY BE ALL UNTRUE ALTHOUGH IT DOES STAND HERE PRINTED IN BLACK AND WHITE
AND LITTLE GERDA WALKED ON BRAVELY AND IN SECURITY
THEN CAME THE GRASSHOPPER
AT LENGTH SHE TOOK THE SHOES OFF AND THEN HER LEGS HAD PEACE
AND THUS IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT HIS SHADOW SHOULD FALL ON HIS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S WALL
A LITTLE TRIP TO FREDERICKSBURG WOULD DO ME NO GREAT HARM THOUGHT HE
SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND THERE STOOD BEFORE HIM SUCH AN EXTREMELY LEAN MAN THAT HE FELT QUITE STRANGE
YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID THE HAIR-COMB
I WILL GO TO THE WARS SHOUTED THE PEWTER SOLDIER AS LOUD AS HE COULD AND THREW HIMSELF OFF THE DRAWERS RIGHT DOWN ON THE FLOOR
WHILE A COLD PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN THE BACK OF THE POOR COUNCILLOR
WHAT THOUGHT HE AGAIN
IT IS THE VERY THING WE WERE THINKING OF YOU MAY BELIEVE EVERY WORD I SAY SAID THE RAVEN
I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER-HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT
IN FORMER TIMES I HAD THE FINEST FISH AND NOW I HAVE FRESH ROSY-CHEEKED BOYS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE WHO LEARN WISDOM HEBREW GREEK--CROAK SORBE A VERY QUIET LITTLE TOWN BEAUTIFULLY SITUATED SURROUNDED BY WOODS AND LAKES
SO THAT AT FIRST ONE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER IT WAS A STUFF OR A NATURAL GREEN AND REAL FLOWERS
FOR I DON'T LIKE TO BE IN ANY SORT OF DEBT HOW CANST THOU TALK SO SAID THE LEARNED MAN
AND THE ELDER TREE STILL WAS FRAGRANT AND THE RED FLAG WITH THE WHITE CROSS WAS STILL WAVING
AND HE WAS VERY PROUD
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE DREAMED AND YET AS IF HE WERE NOT DREAMING
BUT SHE GLANCED SORROWFULLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AT HER CRUTCHES
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW--THE TREE GONE THE STORY AT AN END
THE SEEMINGLY DEAD BODY OF THE WATCHMAN WANDERED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE IT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE GENERAL VIEWING-ROOM
NOW SHE MIGHT WELL SING ACH
OFT ASKED I FOR THIS BOON
THE LITTLE MAIDEN WITH THE BLUE EYES AND WITH ELDER-BLOSSOMS IN HER HAIR SAT IN THE TREE NODDED TO BOTH OF THEM AND SAID TO-DAY IS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY AND THEN SHE TOOK TWO FLOWERS OUT OF HER HAIR AND KISSED THEM
THE FRIGHTENED CANARY FLUTTERED ABOUT IN HIS CAGE
SQUEAK SAID A LITTLE MOUSE AT THE SAME MOMENT PEEPING OUT OF HIS HOLE
IT IS SO LONELY AND MELANCHOLY HERE
MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE BUT ONE ONLY RETURNED WITH A SORT OF EXPLANATION
THEY NOW ENTERED THE FIRST SALOON WHICH WAS OF ROSE-COLORED SATIN WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS ON THE WALL
IN SHORT HE WAS TRAVELLING
I SHALL NEVER FORGET MY FIRST LOVE--SHE WAS A GIRDLE SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO CHARMING SHE THREW HERSELF INTO A TUB OF WATER FOR MY SAKE
THAT IS TO SAY AN INSIDE GIRDLE
IT WAS THATCHED AND BEFORE IT TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS STOOD SENTRY AND PRESENTED ARMS WHEN ANYONE WENT PAST
BUT WHEN THE SPRING WITH A GENTLE STIRRING MOTION ANNOUNCED HER ARRIVAL A NEW AND BUSY LIFE AROSE
THE PRINCESS NOW STOOD AND WEPT THE SWINEHERD SCOLDED AND THE RAIN POURED DOWN
AND THEN TOO I SMELL SO DELICIOUSLY FOR CLOSE BEFORE THE GATE BLOOM THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROSES CORSOR ON THE GREAT BELT CALLED FORMERLY BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF STEAM-VESSELS WHEN TRAVELLERS WERE OFTEN OBLIGED TO WAIT A LONG TIME FOR A FAVORABLE WIND THE MOST TIRESOME OF TOWNS THE POET BAGGESEN WAS BORN HERE
IF I CAN KISS HIM SURELY YOU CAN
I ONLY HOPE HE IS NOT UNWELL SAID THE HOUSE-DOG
HOWEVER HE WAS NOT TO BE DISCOURAGED
GRAND SOLEMN AND DARK WAS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE AROUND
IT IS SO WET IN THE GARDEN THOUGH THE SUN IS SHINING MOST INVITINGLY
HER HEAD BECAME SO HEAVY--SHE HAD NOT CLOSED HER EYES FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS
AND HERE WAS A NEW AND BRILLIANT PROOF OF THE WISDOM OF THE OLD APOTHEGM
AND WHERE ON THIS ACCOUNT MOST PERSONS ARE OBLIGED TO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH FLOWERS IN POTS
IT WAS SO WET IT CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN RAINING
SO YOU ARE GOING AWAY AGAIN SAID THE CLERK
YES THE SHADOW WAS WELL-DRESSED AND IT WAS JUST THAT WHICH MADE IT QUITE A MAN
BUT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES EVER THINKS OF PRINTING THEM
UNLESS LIKE THE WATCHMAN OF EAST STREET WE HAPPEN TO HAVE ON THE SHOES OF FORTUNE
THREE FAMOUS JUMPERS WERE THEY AS EVERYONE WOULD SAY WHEN THEY ALL MET TOGETHER IN THE ROOM
IT MUST BE THE SUMMER AIR THAT AFFECTS ME WITH FEELINGS ALMOST AS DISQUIETING AS THEY ARE REFRESHING HE FELT IN HIS POCKET FOR THE PAPERS
LOVELY ROSES NODDED FROM THE WOODEN FLOWER-BOXES ON THE ROOF AND TWO SKY-BLUE BIRDS SANG REJOICINGLY WHILE THE SICK MOTHER IMPLORED GOD'S RICHEST BLESSINGS ON HER PIOUS DAUGHTER
HE IS CERTAINLY THOUGHT HE SOME VILLAGE SCHOOLMASTER--SOME QUEER OLD FELLOW SUCH AS ONE STILL OFTEN MEETS WITH IN JUTLAND THIS IS NO LOCUS DOCENDI IT IS TRUE BEGAN THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN
SHE SAT IN THE PEW WITH THE CLERGYMAN'S FAMILY AND WHEN THEY HAD ENDED THE PSALM AND LOOKED UP THEY NODDED AND SAID IT IS RIGHT THAT THOU ART COME IT WAS THROUGH MERCY SHE SAID
HIS SLEEP OF DEATH WAS ENDED
I WILL GO TO THE WARS
WAS HE AMONG THE NUMBER PATIENCE PATIENCE
HE NODDED AND SAID TO THEM IT MUST BE VERY TIRESOME TO STAND ON THE STAIRS
WHAT A SPLENDID DESIGN
CAN A DOG OR A HORSE LAUGH
FATHER SNAIL COULD NOT SPEAK HE WAS TOO MUCH AFFECTED
YOU CANNOT ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS SAID THE PRINCESS
WHO HEARING ON EVERY SIDE THAT HE WAS INTOXICATED DID NOT IN THE LEAST DOUBT THE TRUTH OF THIS CERTAINLY NOT VERY POLITE ASSERTION
I CANNOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER SAID THE PEWTER SOLDIER WHO SAT ON THE DRAWERS
AND A HUNDRED VISIONS GLIDED BEFORE HIS MIND
AND THEN HE HUMMED A SONG
WHERE COULD HE BE
FROM CHILDREN THEY BECOME ALL AT ONCE GROWN-UP-PERSONS
AT LAST SHE SAID HE MUST BE DEAD
YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES AND THEN HE TOLD ABOUT CHRISTMAS-EVE WHEN HE WAS DECKED OUT WITH CAKES AND CANDLES
NAY IT CANNOT BE HE
TWO LITTLE GIRLS ARE SITTING IN IT AND SWING THEMSELVES BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
THE GRANDMOTHER SAT IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE AND READ ALOUD FROM THE BIBLE
BUT YET THEY MOVED A LITTLE WHEN THE ROBBER MAIDEN CAME
AND SHE NO LONGER APPEARED OF ICE AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SAT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND BECKONED TO HIM
BUT NOW HE HAS FORGOTTEN YOU FOR THE PRINCESS DOES HE LIVE WITH A PRINCESS ASKED GERDA
THAT IS VERY ODD
SHE HAS NO DOUBT TAKEN THEM FOR HERSELF TO KEEP THEM TO ALL ETERNITY
HE MADE A JUMP ALL ON ONE SIDE INTO THE LAP OF THE PRINCESS WHO WAS SITTING ON A LITTLE GOLDEN STOOL CLOSE BY
JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE MERRY OLD MAN CAME IN WHO LIVED UP A-TOP OF THE HOUSE ALL ALONE
THEY SAY AT HOME SAID THE LITTLE BOY THAT YOU ARE SO VERY VERY LONELY OH SAID HE
SHE DREW ANOTHER MATCH AGAINST THE WALL
AS TO A PAVEMENT I CAN FIND NO TRACES OF ONE AND ALL THE LAMPS IT SEEMS HAVE GONE TO SLEEP THE MOON WAS NOT YET VERY HIGH
THE ROAD LED THROUGH AN OLIVE-GROVE AND HERE THE SOLITARY INN WAS SITUATED
IT IS WET
IT IS WET
BUT I CANNOT SUPPOSE IT--IT WAS TOO REALLY VERY WRONG TO GIVE US PUNCH AND HOT SALMON FOR SUPPER
AND I AS YOU KNOW WELL HAVE FROM A CHILD FOLLOWED IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS
I WILL STILL HOPE THAT IT IS NOT A REAL BIRD SAID THE PRINCESS
I INTEND TO GET BETROTHED FOR I CAN PROVIDE FOR MORE THAN ONE FAMILY BE QUITE AT THY EASE ABOUT THAT SAID THE LEARNED MAN
EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES BE REPEATED AT PLEASURE
WHILE HE THOUGHT OF THIS AND OF THE WHOLE METAMORPHOSIS HE HAD UNDERGONE HE SMILED AND SAID I SLEEP AND DREAM
HE HAS MORE THAN ONCE JOKED ABOUT IT WITH HIS HIGH VASSALS I HAVE NOT READ THAT NOVEL SAID THE COUNCILLOR
AND HE PUT HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE SOLES
MEN CANNOT PLANT ME NOW AND THEREFORE I HAVE BEEN PUT UP HERE UNDER SHELTER TILL THE SPRING-TIME COMES
THE FLOOR OF THE ROOMS PRESENTED A STONE PAVING HALF TORN UP
THE HIGHER THEY FLEW WITH THE MIRROR THE MORE TERRIBLY IT GRINNED
NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IT HAD--SEALS GOLD NECK-CHAIN AND DIAMOND RINGS
ALL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS HOW THE STORY WILL END THE TWO SCHOOLBOYS THE PROPRIETORS NOW OF THE TRANSFORMED CLERK CARRIED HIM INTO AN ELEGANT ROOM
ONE EVENING AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ROOM THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
SHE KISSED HIS EYES AND THEY SHONE LIKE HER OWN
IT WAS VEXATIOUS
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING WRONG
HAS SHE A HOUSE SHE HAS A PALACE SAID THE ANT
GRANDMOTHER CRIED THE LITTLE ONE
THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER
THESE ARE THE SAME TONES THE SAME EXECUTION YES
HE LOOKED AT HIS WOODEN SHOES PULLED AT THE SHORT SLEEVES OF HIS JACKET AND SAID THAT HE WAS AFRAID HE COULD NOT WALK SO FAST
OH HOW TENDER AND WEARIED HER LITTLE FEET WERE
DON'T YOU SEE HOW GREAT IT IS
BUT THEN THOU MUST SUBMIT TO BE CALLED SHADOW BY ALL AND EVERYONE
AND THE MORE HE LOOKED AT IT THE FRESHER IT BECAME
BUT HER FIXED ABODE IS HIGH UP TOWARDS THE NORTH POLE ON THE ISLAND CALLED SPITZBERGEN OH KAY
I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE
OH SAID THE LITTLE MICE HOW FORTUNATE YOU HAVE BEEN OLD FIR TREE I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID HE
SUMMER GLORIOUS SUMMER
AND WHERE HAVE I BEEN HE LOOKED ROUND HIM
THE SHADOW IT IS IN THE HOT LANDS THAT THE SUN BURNS SURE ENOUGH
TAKE THEM AGAIN THEY ARE NOW BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE
HIS GAMES NOW WERE QUITE DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN THEY WERE SO VERY KNOWING
ONE SLIPPER WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
WHAT'S THE HOUR WATCHMAN ASKED A PASSER-BY
WHEN SUDDENLY HE LET GO THE STRING HE HELD IN HIS HAND IN ORDER TO GET LOOSE FROM THE SLEDGE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
I WAS THERE MYSELF TO LOOK SAID THE RAVEN
HE LOOKED SO NOBLE THAT THE PRINCESS COULD NOT HELP BOWING BEFORE HIM
SUCH IS MY FATE
THE PROFESSORS MADE A PROFESSOR OF ME
WASN'T THIS A LADY OF REAL DELICACY
TIS NOW WINTER OUT-OF-DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE
IT WAS JUST THE SAME WITH THIS GENTLEMAN AS WITH THE MINISTER
BUT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED AND HIS EYE FELL AGAIN ON THE SHOES HE WAS UNABLE TO SAY WHETHER THOSE TO THE LEFT OR THOSE TO THE RIGHT BELONGED TO HIM
THE CLOCK SAID TICK
WHAT SAID GERDA
SOME DAYS AFTERWARDS THERE WAS AN AUCTION AT THE OLD HOUSE AND THE LITTLE BOY SAW FROM HIS WINDOW HOW THEY CARRIED THE OLD KNIGHTS AND THE OLD LADIES AWAY THE FLOWER-POTS WITH THE LONG EARS THE OLD CHAIRS AND THE OLD CLOTHES-PRESSES
MOTHER I HAVE BEEN TO WARM COUNTRIES SO I SHOULD THINK SAID HIS MOTHER
WITH HER ARMS ROUND HER NECK AND PULLING HER BY THE BEARD SAID GOOD MORROW MY OWN SWEET NANNY-GOAT OF A MOTHER AND HER MOTHER TOOK HOLD OF HER NOSE AND PINCHED IT TILL IT WAS RED AND BLUE
IT WAS A KING'S SON WHO SPOKE
IT IS AS TRUE AS I AM SITTING HERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EMPTY ENDLESS HALL OF SNOW WAS A FROZEN LAKE
BUT GOD'S WARM SUN STREAMED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW
YOU SEE THAT THE MEN ARE GONE
THERE IS TOO A LETTER TO ME
WHEN THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS COME FROM THE LECTURES HE RUNS BESIDE THEM IN A BLACK COAT AND WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM
TO REACH UP TO THE BELL WAS WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE
THEY SAT IN AN AERIAL DWELLING AND IT FLEW WITH THEM THROUGH THE AIR
THE FOREST GREW RED AND GREEN AND YELLOW-COLORED
WHAT A BLESSED LAND THAT MUST BE
THEY WERE SO AFRAID OF ME AND YET THEY WERE SO EXCESSIVELY FOND OF ME
HE BEGGED PERMISSION OF THE WORTHY AUDIENCE AND SET HIS SPECTACLES ON HIS NOSE
BUT THE DISTRESSED MOTHER BENT DOWN OVER ALL THE SMALLEST PLANTS AND HEARD WITHIN THEM HOW THE HUMAN HEART BEAT
AND SHE SMILED WHILE HE SPOKE
THERE IT SAT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE BETWEEN THE FLOWERS ON THE BALCONY
IT WAS THE HEART OF A MOST RESPECTABLE RICH MAN WHOSE NAME IS CERTAIN TO BE FOUND IN THE DIRECTORY
AT LAST HE WAS FORCED TO REST A LITTLE
BUT THEY ARE PROUD AND HAUGHTY AND COME ONLY WHEN THEY CHOOSE
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A TRAVELLING COMPANION
THE THREE PEAS WERE HOWEVER PUT INTO THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES WHERE THEY ARE STILL TO BE SEEN PROVIDED THEY ARE NOT LOST
I SAW EVERYTHING AND I SHALL TELL ALL TO YOU
THE POETS HAUCH AND INGEMANN WERE APPOINTED PROFESSORS HERE
NOW THERE WAS NO OTHER TO COURT AND SO HE DESPISED IT
HIS THOUGHTS WERE SO ELASTIC HIS HEART SO TENDER
BUT THAT WHICH WAS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING AND LOOKED UGLY WAS SHOWN MAGNIFIED AND INCREASED IN UGLINESS
ONE DAY HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR FOR HE HAD MADE A MIRROR WITH THE POWER OF CAUSING ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN IT WAS REFLECTED THEREIN TO LOOK POOR AND MEAN
AND SEVERAL DRAWERS WERE OPENED AND THE PIANO WAS OPENED
POOR THING SAID THE OLD POET AS HE WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR
BUT THE NARCISSUS GAVE HER A KNOCK ON THE LEG JUST AS SHE WAS GOING TO JUMP OVER IT
HE SAW CLEARLY THAT IT WAS HIS IRREVOCABLE DESTINY TO REMAIN A PRISONER TILL DAWN OR PERHAPS EVEN LATE IN THE MORNING
AND FROM AMONG THE LEAVES OF THE FLOWERS HE COULD DISTINCTLY SEE THE LITTLE MAIDEN PEEPING FORTH WITH HER BRIGHT BLUE EYES--AND THEN SHE WHISPERED IT IS DELIGHTFUL HERE IN SPRING SUMMER AUTUMN AND WINTER
WHERE DID THE SNOW QUEEN GO TO
DOES YOUR HONOR WANT TO CROSS THE FERRY TO THE HOLME ASKED THEY
THAT SUMMER THE ROSES FLOWERED IN UNWONTED BEAUTY
ONE MORNING SHE DANCED PAST A DOOR WHICH SHE WELL KNEW
A LONG TIME PASSED AWAY THEN THE COLLAR CAME INTO THE RAG CHEST AT THE PAPER MILL
CAN I HAVE EMPLOYMENT AT THE PALACE WHY YES SAID THE EMPEROR
SO SHE TOLD THE RAVEN HER WHOLE HISTORY AND ASKED IF HE HAD NOT SEEN KAY
SOME OF THE BROKEN PIECES WERE SO LARGE THAT THEY WERE USED FOR WINDOWPANES THROUGH WHICH ONE COULD NOT SEE ONE'S FRIENDS
IT IS A GREAT DELIGHT AND ALL THIS DELIGHTFULNESS IS SNAILS FOOD
THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL MOST TERRIBLY COLD IT WAS
THE SUN'S LIGHT WANTS EIGHT MINUTES AND SOME SECONDS TO PERFORM A JOURNEY OF MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION OF OUR DANISH MILES
AND SHE NOW FLEW OVER ZEALAND--OVER THE GREEN WOODS AND THE BLUE LAKES
THE LAST INGREDIENT PLAYED A VERY PROMINENT PART IN THE SALAD
AFTERWARDS THERE CAME A MESSAGE
WE BOTH CRIED
THE YOUNG MAN WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW PATHS AS WELL AS THE PRESCRIBED LIMITS WOULD ALLOW
THEN THE WOOD-PIGEONS SAID COO
BUT NO THAT WOULD BE TOO SILLY
BUT HE FELT A SYMPATHY FOR THE LITTLE GIRL AND ASKED HER WHERE SHE WAS GOING ALL ALONE
FOR THEY INDEED WERE SO
NO THAT WAS CERTAINLY HIS SLEDGE SAID GERDA
COME LET US BE MEN
FOR THAT IT ALWAYS DOES
AND CONTINUED TO WORK WITH AS MUCH APPARENT DILIGENCE AS BEFORE AT THEIR EMPTY LOOMS
AND HE THINKS IT THE VERY BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
HE WAS SOON MET BY TWO SCHOOLBOYS OF THE UPPER CLASS--THAT IS TO SAY AS INDIVIDUALS FOR WITH REGARD TO LEARNING THEY WERE IN THE LOWEST CLASS IN THE SCHOOL
THE STRING IS QUITE TIGHT
BUT WENT QUIETLY INTO THE BEDROOM TOOK ALL THE BED-CLOTHES OFF THE BED AND PUT THREE LITTLE PEAS ON THE BEDSTEAD
AND THUS MUST THE SUDDEN CHANGE WITH THE CLERK STRIKE THE READER
THE NEXT MORNING SHE WAS ASKED HOW SHE HAD SLEPT
AND THAT WAS SO ALARMING
WHY THERE IS MY PIECE SAID THE PRINCESS
AND THEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND LITTLE SISTER MARY WHO IS NOT TWO YEARS OLD YET AND WHO ALWAYS DANCES WHEN SHE HEARS MUSIC OR SINGING OF WHATEVER KIND IT MAY BE WAS PUT INTO THE ROOM--THOUGH SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN THERE--AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BUT COULD NOT KEEP TIME BECAUSE THE TONES WERE SO LONG
AMONG THE LATTER THERE MAY BE FAR MORE POETICAL NATURES THAN MANY AN ACKNOWLEDGED POET WHEN EXAMINED MORE CLOSELY COULD BOAST OF
THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES
I SAY NOTHING IT IS TRUE EXCLAIMED THE KING
THE SNOW QUEEN MIGHT COME BACK AS SOON AS SHE LIKED
IF ONE HOLDS IT BEFORE ONE IT IS LIKE A WHOLE APRON AND IF ONE HOLDS IT OVER ONE'S HEAD IN RAINY WEATHER IT IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS AN UMBRELLA FOR IT IS SO IMMENSELY LARGE
AND WHEN MATTERS GREW TO TOO HIGH A PITCH THEN THE BACHELOR TALKED LATIN IN THE HOPE OF BEING BETTER UNDERSTOOD--BUT IT WAS OF NO USE AFTER ALL
THE MOST CHARMING BLUE LIGHTS BURNED THE WHOLE NIGHT IN THE SKY AND AT LAST THEY CAME TO FINLAND
THE KING'S SON OFTEN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED
THE LEATHER IS SO SOFT AND SUPPLE THEY FITTED HIS FEET AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM
SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE
AND SO SHE ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION DIRECTLY WITH THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN ON THEIR PROMENADES
AND YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT INSULT ANY BELONGING TO THE CONSTABULARY FORCE WITHOUT A CHASTISEMENT
THEY CLOSED THEIR EYES AND--AND
BUT HE DID NOT LIKE DISTURBING THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR BEDS AND SO VERY CONSIDERATELY HE LEFT THE MATTER ALONE
HOWEVER THEY SHOULD HAVE A REWARD
HE WAS A VERY KIND-HEARTED MAN AND PARTICULARLY MILD AND FRIENDLY AND SO HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE SHADOW
AND ALL DIED EXCEPT WE TWO
THEY CERTAINLY THOUGHT HOW LONG IS THAT OLD DECAYED THING TO STAND HERE AS A SPECTACLE IN THE STREET
KAREN RAISED HER FOOT TO GET IN AFTER HER WHEN THE OLD SOLDIER SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES AND KAREN COULD NOT HELP DANCING A STEP OR TWO AND WHEN SHE BEGAN HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE
BUT THEY COULD NOT EXACTLY RECOLLECT THE DATE
A FEW SNOW-FLAKES WERE FALLING AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER-POT
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO TONES
SHE REMARKED SHE WAS WITHOUT THEM FROM THE CUTTING FROST
THE SLOES ONLY STOOD FULL OF FRUIT WHICH SET ONE'S TEETH ON EDGE
FOR THESE ONE LOOKED MUCH MORE ANXIOUSLY THAN FOR THE CHARMS OF NATURE WHICH EVERY WHERE WERE SO PROFUSELY DISPLAYED
BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER
BUT THERE WE SHALL NOT MEET SAID THE KING'S SON NODDING AT THE SAME TIME TO THE POOR BOY WHO WENT INTO THE DARKEST THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THORNS TORE HIS HUMBLE DRESS AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND HANDS AND FEET TILL THEY BLED
AND WHEREVER THEY WENT THE WINDS CEASED RAGING AND THE SUN BURST FORTH
THAT IS PROBABLY A WAX-WORK SHOW THOUGHT HE
DU LIEBER AUGUSTIN ALLES IST WEG WEG WEG STAY SAID THE PRINCESS
THAT IS STILL BETTER THAN TO CROSS THE SEA
IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE
SO THE NIGHTINGALE CAME FORTH AND SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT AT FIRST NO ONE COULD SAY ANYTHING ILL-HUMORED OF HER
NEITHER THE CHAFERS THE TOADS NOR THE EARTH-WORMS WHOM THEY ASKED ABOUT IT COULD GIVE THEM ANY INFORMATION--NONE OF THEM HAD BEEN BOILED OR LAID ON A SILVER DISH
HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM
SHE RECOGNISED GERDA IMMEDIATELY AND GERDA KNEW HER TOO
IT WISHED TO KNOW HOW IT COULD GET FREE AND WORK ITS WAY UP SO AS TO BECOME ITS OWN MASTER
PEOPLE CAME IN CROWDS
IT WAS OF PURE GOLD AND THE ARMS OF THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS SHONE LIKE A STAR UPON IT
FOR THE CHURCH ITSELF HAD COME TO THE POOR GIRL IN HER NARROW CHAMBER OR ELSE SHE HAD COME INTO THE CHURCH
I CAN NOW SAID HE TO HIMSELF FANCY THE WHOLE ROW OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SITTING THERE IN THE FRONT ROW
FOURTH STORY
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DECENT SHOP FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
YOU ARE A FINE FELLOW FOR TRAMPING ABOUT SAID SHE TO LITTLE KAY
AND OUT OF THE WOOD CAME RIDING ON A MAGNIFICENT HORSE WHICH GERDA KNEW IT WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE GOLDEN CARRIAGE A YOUNG DAMSEL WITH A BRIGHT-RED CAP ON HER HEAD AND ARMED WITH PISTOLS
FOR I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING HOW DID IT LOOK IN THE FURTHEST SALOON ASKED THE LEARNED MAN
I ONLY DO HIS BIDDING SAID DEATH
THAT WAS AN UNPLEASANT DREAM SAID HE
AND THE LITTLE MICE JUMPED FOR JOY UP TO THE VERY TOP OF THE TREE
THE CHILDREN THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
THEY INCREASED IN NUMBERS
ALL NATURE WAS A VAST HOLY CHURCH IN WHICH THE TREES AND THE BUOYANT CLOUDS WERE THE PILLARS FLOWERS AND GRASS THE VELVET CARPETING AND HEAVEN ITSELF THE LARGE CUPOLA
VERY VERY LONELY SAID THE PEWTER SOLDIER
IT WAS LOVELY SPRING WEATHER WITH ABUNDANCE OF FLOWERS AND OF VERDURE
O THOU TO WHOM I DO MY HEART DEVOTE OH READ THIS PAGE OF GLAD DAYS NOW REMOTE A DARK DARK TALE WHICH I TONIGHT DEVOTE
IT WAS A WHOLE WEEK BEFORE SHE ARRIVED
ONLY LET HER COME IN SAID THE LITTLE BOY
WELL THEN LET THE BIRD FLY SAID THE PRINCESS
WHEN SHE SPOKE IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE THE NOISE OF FROGS OR AS IF ONE WALKED WITH GREAT BOOTS OVER A MOOR
AND GERDA WEPT AND THE RAVEN WEPT
LITTLE TUKEY
HE NOW OPENED THEM QUITE WIDE--YES HE WAS QUITE AWAKE
IT WAS COLDER THAN ICE
ONE WAS WHITE AND IN THIS LAY THE PRINCESS
HE WAS AWAY AND HE STAYED AWAY
AND YET SHE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW IF LITTLE KAY WAS THERE
THE OLD WOMAN FEARED THAT IF GERDA SHOULD SEE THE ROSES SHE WOULD THEN THINK OF HER OWN WOULD REMEMBER LITTLE KAY AND RUN AWAY FROM HER
AND THE MOTHER LOOKED DOWN IN HER LAP AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN OVER HER CHEEKS
I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU FOR THEY LIFTED THEMSELVES ON HIGH MOST MAJESTICALLY OH WERE I BUT OLD ENOUGH TO FLY ACROSS THE SEA
AND THE DISCOURSE PASSED OFF SATISFACTORILY ENOUGH
AROUND THE NICEST GREEN MEADS WHERE THE DEER WERE PLAYING IN THE GRASS GREW MAGNIFICENT OAKS AND BEECHES
THE ROBBER MAIDEN LIFTED UP LITTLE GERDA AND TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO BIND HER FAST ON THE REINDEER'S BACK
AND I HAVE ALWAYS A WITTY ANSWER AT HAND
AND THEN THE CLOCK ALSO STOOD STILL
THE CLOCK STRUCK SIX
HERE STOOD OLD FLOWER-POTS WITH FACES AND ASSES EARS AND THE FLOWERS GREW JUST AS THEY LIKED
BUT STRIKE OFF MY FEET IN THE RED SHOES AND THEN SHE CONFESSED HER ENTIRE SIN AND THE EXECUTIONER STRUCK OFF HER FEET WITH THE RED SHOES BUT THE SHOES DANCED AWAY WITH THE LITTLE FEET ACROSS THE FIELD INTO THE DEEP WOOD
THE TAILORS HAD THEIRS WITH A PAIR OF SHEARS HELD BY TWO LIONS--AND THE SHOEMAKERS THEIRS WITHOUT BOOTS BUT WITH AN EAGLE THAT HAD TWO HEADS FOR THE SHOEMAKERS MUST HAVE EVERYTHING SO THAT THEY CAN SAY IT IS A PAIR
BUT THE SUN SHONE ON HIS PATH AND IT IS HIM THAT WE WILL FOLLOW FOR HE WAS AN EXCELLENT AND RESOLUTE YOUTH
THERE IS NOT A FAULT IN THEM IF THEY DID NOT MELT IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT KAY CAME ONE DAY WITH LARGE GLOVES ON AND HIS LITTLE SLEDGE AT HIS BACK AND BAWLED RIGHT INTO GERDA'S EARS I HAVE PERMISSION TO GO OUT INTO THE SQUARE WHERE THE OTHERS ARE PLAYING
AND THEN SHE STOOD FIRST ON THE ONE LEG AND BENT HER HEAD FORWARDS AND THEN ON THE OTHER LEG AND BENT HER HEAD FORWARDS--BUT ALL WOULD NOT DO
SHE NEITHER SAID THANKEE THANKEE NOR CRANKY CRANKY BUT LOOKED WITH HER MILD EYES AT THE LITTLE BOY WHO DIRECTLY ASKED THE OLD MAN WHERE DID YOU GET HER YONDER AT THE BROKER'S SAID THE OLD MAN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY PICTURES HANGING
THINGS HAVE GONE ON WELL WITH ME SINCE I WAS LAST WITH YOU
AND THEN SHE GREW LESS SAD
THITHER YOU MAY CARRY THE LITTLE GIRL
THE SEA--THE GREAT THE GLORIOUS SEA THAT DASHED ITS LONG WAVES AGAINST THE COAST--WAS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HIM
AND WHILE HE SO THOUGHT ALL HIS IDEAS AND FEELINGS OF OVERPOWERING DIZZINESS AGAINST WHICH HE STRUGGLED WITH THE UTMOST POWER OF DESPERATION ENCOMPASSED HIM WITH RENEWED FORCE
BUT NO ONE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE ARRIVED IN HER OWN KINGDOM
OH NOW I'VE FOUND HIM AND SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY
HIS WISH WAS FULFILLED--THE BODY RESTED WHILE THE SPIRIT WENT UNHINDERED ON ITS PILGRIMAGE
GOOD DAY
WHAT WOODEN SCAFFOLDING IS THAT WHICH THEY HAVE SET UP THERE CRIED HE INVOLUNTARILY AS HE LOOKED AT EAST GATE WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS AT THE END OF EAST STREET
WHAT SPLENDOR
THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET AND ANGELS DESCEND THERE THE CHILDREN TO GREET HEREUPON KAY BURST INTO TEARS
DO TELL ME SOMETHING
LOVELY FLOWERS VENERABLE TREES AND SLOPES WITH SHEEP AND COWS BUT NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS TO BE SEEN
WHAT HAPPENS THEN WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING MORE
TELL IT ME
YOU STOOD DEVOUTLY WITH FOLDED HANDS
BUT GERDA REPEATED HER EVENING PRAYER AND THE WINDS WERE LAID AS THOUGH THEY SLEPT
THE OLD POET SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HIS HEARTH AND TOOK THE LITTLE FELLOW ON HIS LAP
HIS NAME WAS KAY HERS WAS GERDA
THEY CALL HER OLD GRANNY'--AND SHE IT IS TO WHOM YOU ARE TO PAY ATTENTION
THEN THE REINDEER RELATED HIS OWN STORY FIRST AND AFTERWARDS THAT OF LITTLE GERDA
BUT HE WAS FORCED IN SPITE OF HIS OPPOSITION TO DRINK WITH THE REST
HERE ONE OF THE SORROWS OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS REAL POETRY GAVE ITSELF VENT
AND THE WEATHER THAT HAD THREATENED RAIN BEGAN TO CLEAR UP WHILE GAILY DRESSED HOLIDAY FOLKS FILLED THE STREETS
AND THEN SHE FELT THE COLD LESS AND WENT ON QUICKLY TOWARDS THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN
BUT AS SOON AS THEY CAME INSIDE THE PALACE GATES AND SAW THE GUARD RICHLY DRESSED IN SILVER AND THE LACKEYS IN GOLD ON THE STAIRCASE AND THE LARGE ILLUMINATED SALOONS THEN THEY WERE ABASHED
TO BE SURE HE THOUGHT HE HAD NOTHING TO RISK IN HIS OWN PERSON
I MUST HAVE A LOOK DOWN INTO THE BLACK CALDRONS IT WAS THE VOLCANOES VESUVIUS AND ETNA THAT SHE MEANT
THE SNOW DRIFTED AND THE SLEDGE FLEW ON AND SOMETIMES IT GAVE A JERK AS THOUGH THEY WERE DRIVING OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES
THE PRINCE WAS ONLY LIKE HIM ABOUT THE NECK
IN THE EVENING THERE WAS A HEARSE SEEN BEFORE THE DOOR AND HE WAS BORNE INTO IT IN HIS COFFIN
THERE WERE MORE THAN A HUNDRED HALLS THERE ACCORDING AS THE SNOW WAS DRIVEN BY THE WINDS
IT IS REALLY PITIABLE PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE GETS INTO THE HANDS OF A LITTLE BLACKGUARD PERFECT IN ALL SORTS OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
BUT WHEN SHE WAS NEAR IT THE RED SHOES DANCED BEFORE HER AND SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND TURNED ROUND
IT GREW THICKER AND THICKER AND TOOK THE FORM OF LITTLE ANGELS THAT GREW MORE AND MORE WHEN THEY TOUCHED THE EARTH
FIRST I WAS A POET
THEY SHINE SO YES THEY SHINE SAID KAREN AND THEY FITTED AND WERE BOUGHT BUT THE OLD LADY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEIR BEING RED ELSE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED KAREN TO HAVE GONE IN RED SHOES TO BE CONFIRMED
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF AN ORGAN WERE ACCOMPANYING IT AND THE TONES CAME FROM THE LEFT HAND THE SIDE WHERE THE HEART IS PLACED
IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE WHEN I LOOK UP TO HIM YOU MUST NOT SCOLD HIM SAID MOTHER SNAIL
A LONG WAY OFF ON GREAT VOYAGES YES MANY A TIME HAVE I WEPT FOR YOUR SAKE SAID SHE
BUT THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND
SHE SAT STILL AND LISTENED WHEN THE CLERGYMAN READ THE BIBLE IN THE EVENINGS
PROBABLY A TRANSLATION OF THE CELEBRATED MOON HOAX WRITTEN BY RICHARD A
AND THEN PEOPLE SAW EVERYTHING PERVERTED OR ONLY HAD AN EYE FOR THAT WHICH WAS EVIL
SUPERBE
LEND ME YOUR GALOSHES SAID HE
SHE POURS WATER OUT OF THE TEAPOT OVER A PIECE OF STUFF WHICH SHE HOLDS IN HER HAND
I CANNOT RECOVER FROM MY SURPRISE SAID THE LEARNED MAN
THESE SHOES POSSESS THE PROPERTY OF INSTANTLY TRANSPORTING HIM WHO HAS THEM ON TO THE PLACE OR THE PERIOD IN WHICH HE MOST WISHES TO BE
I HAVE OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH A DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
SHE SAW THE OLD PICTURES OF THE PREACHERS AND THE PREACHERS WIVES
UP IN THE LITTLE GARRET THERE STANDS HALF-DRESSED A LITTLE DANCER
AND SO I BECAME THE MAN I AM
BUT I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE GARTER--I MEAN THE GIRDLE--THAT WENT INTO THE WATER-TUB
COULD WE RENDER THIS INIMITABLE PICTURE PROPERLY THEN WOULD EVERYBODY EXCLAIM BEAUTIFUL UNPARALLELED ITALY BUT NEITHER THE YOUNG DIVINE SAID SO NOR ANYONE OF HIS GRUMBLING COMPANIONS IN THE COACH OF THE VETTURINO
FOR I HAVE A TAME SWEETHEART THAT HOPS ABOUT IN THE PALACE QUITE FREE AND IT WAS SHE WHO TOLD ME ALL THIS
YOU WILL SEE THAT IT WILL BE WET HERE
AND SHE DRIED GERDA'S EYES AND PUT BOTH HER HANDS IN THE HANDSOME MUFF WHICH WAS SO SOFT AND WARM
ONE CAN SPRING ABOUT IN THE LARGE SHINING VALLEYS
AND THEN UNPERCEIVED HE THRUSTS AN ARROW TO THEIR BOSOM
BUT NO ONE HEARD HER EXCEPT THE SPARROWS AND THEY COULD NOT CARRY HER TO LAND
BUT YOUR BLUE UNIFORM BETRAYS WHERE YOU COME FROM THIS FINE TIRADE SOUNDED HOWEVER TO THE UNGODLY SAILOR-BOY LIKE A MERE PIPPI-PI HE GAVE THE NOISY BIRD A KNOCK ON HIS BEAK AND WALKED ON
HEM
BUT THIS SEEMED TO HIM LIKE A LARGE HOLY FANE
YET SUCH WAS THE CASE
CERTAINLY NONE OF THE EMPEROR'S VARIOUS SUITS HAD EVER MADE SO GREAT AN IMPRESSION AS THESE INVISIBLE ONES
WHICH OF THEM IS MISFORTUNE'S FLOWER AND WHICH IS THAT OF HAPPINESS ASKED SHE
ALL YOU CHILDREN STOOD BEFORE THE TABLE AND SUNG YOUR PSALMS AS YOU DO EVERY MORNING
KAY AND GERDA LOOKED AT THE PICTURE-BOOK FULL OF BEASTS AND OF BIRDS
SUCH AN ELECTRIC SHOCK IN THE HEART HOWEVER COSTS US THE USE OF THE BODY HERE BELOW
AND I NOW BID YOU FAREWELL
HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN THERE
DEAR AUGUSTINE
THE BEST THAT THE GALOSHES GAVE THE FOLLOWING DAY EARLY IN THE MORNING WHILE THE CLERK WAS STILL IN BED SOMEONE KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR
OH WERE I RICH
OH WERE I RICH
OH WERE I RICH
OH WERE I RICH
THE WINDOWS WERE QUITE FROZEN THE LITTLE BOY WAS OBLIGED TO SIT AND BREATHE ON THEM TO GET A PEEP-HOLE OVER TO THE OLD HOUSE AND THERE THE SNOW HAD BEEN BLOWN INTO ALL THE CARVED WORK AND INSCRIPTIONS
HUZZA
YES THOSE ARE OUR GRAND-CHILDREN FULL OF STRENGTH AND VIGOR
HE IS AN IMPUDENT FELLOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE WALKED ON
WHAT COLORS
THE OTHER LOOKED EXTREMELY GLOOMY--IT WAS CARE
BUT I HAVE MY OWN OPINION NOTWITHSTANDING NOW THE TRIAL WAS TO TAKE PLACE
KAY IS DEAD AND GONE SAID LITTLE GERDA
THE GIFT OF LAUGHING WAS GIVEN TO MAN ALONE
THOU MUST NOT SAY THAT THOU HAST EVER BEEN A MAN
HOW EMPTY AND COLD AND HE HELD FAST BY GERDA WHO LAUGHED AND WEPT FOR JOY
IN THE BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF DENMARK ARE INTERRED
THEY BELONG NO DOUBT TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO LIVES OVER THE WAY
HE WAS SO CLEVER
IT WAS BRIGHT DAY AND HE WAS NOW QUITE UNABLE TO CALL TO MIND HIS DREAM
WELL THERE HE STOOD
HOW SPLENDID HIS MAJESTY LOOKS IN HIS NEW CLOTHES AND HOW WELL THEY FIT EVERYONE CRIED OUT
COME OUT
THERE IS THE LITTLE BOY
BUT HERE THEY WERE RETAINED AND GUARDED IN THE HEART WHILE THE SOUND PERSONS WENT AWAY
THE GUARDS IN SILVER AND THE LACKEYS IN GOLD WOULD NOT ALLOW IT
IS THIS THE DAILY NEWS OF THIS EVENING HE ASKED MECHANICALLY AS HE SAW THE HOSTESS PUSH ASIDE A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER
FOR I POOR BEAST OF BURDEN THAT I AM HAVE SO MUCH TO ANNOY ME THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT A GOOD APPETITE IS
BORDINGBORG IN THE REIGN OF KING WALDEMAR A CONSIDERABLE PLACE NOW AN UNIMPORTANT LITTLE TOWN
ONE NIGHT THE STRANGER AWOKE--HE SLEPT WITH THE DOORS OF THE BALCONY OPEN--THE CURTAIN BEFORE IT WAS RAISED BY THE WIND AND HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE LUSTRE CAME FROM THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
DO THE DANCING MAIDENS SLEEP OR ARE THEY DEAD
HIS HEAD ACHED TILL IT ALMOST SPLIT HIS WEARY NECK COULD HARDLY BEAR THE HEAVY LOAD AND HIS FEET PINCHED BY HIS TORTURING BOOTS WERE TERRIBLY SWOLLEN
HE WAS HOWEVER RATHER EMBARRASSED WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT A SIMPLETON OR ONE UNFIT FOR HIS OFFICE WOULD BE UNABLE TO SEE THE MANUFACTURE
THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE WALKING OUTSIDE THE TOWN WHERE THE HOUSES WERE FARTHER APART WITH GARDENS OR LITTLE FIELDS BETWEEN THEM COULD SEE THE EVENING SKY STILL BETTER AND HEARD THE SOUND OF THE BELL MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY
AND WHAT WAS STILL MORE CAPITAL TO BEHOLD WAS THE GOOSE HOPPED DOWN FROM THE DISH REELED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR WITH KNIFE AND FORK IN ITS BREAST TILL IT CAME UP TO THE POOR LITTLE GIRL
ALL THE CHILDREN THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HER
OH WERE MY HEAD BUT LOOSE YOU SEE HE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID THAT SOONER
FOR THE BIT OF GLASS WHICH WAS IN HIS EYE CAUSED THIS
AND SO THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE
WHEN THE MOTHER HAD TAKEN A SUP AT HER FLASK AND WAS HAVING A NAP THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN WENT TO THE REINDEER AND SAID I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO GIVE YOU STILL MANY A TICKLING WITH THE SHARP KNIFE FOR THEN YOU ARE SO AMUSING
IT WAS SO OLD THAT IT BEGAN TO THINK OF MARRIAGE
WITH ONE SPRING HE WAS ON THE FLOOR
THE OLD MAN SOUGHT AND THE LITTLE BOY SOUGHT
THE LITTLE BOY RETURNED HOME HAPPY AND PLEASED AND WEEKS AND DAYS PASSED AWAY AND NODS WERE MADE TO THE OLD HOUSE AND FROM THE OLD HOUSE AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY WENT OVER THERE AGAIN
THEY THEN CARRIED KAY AND GERDA--FIRST TO THE FINLAND WOMAN WHERE THEY WARMED THEMSELVES IN THE WARM ROOM AND LEARNED WHAT THEY WERE TO DO ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME
DEAR WIDOW-LADY
SHE SHALL GIVE ME HER MUFF AND HER PRETTY FROCK
THAT WAS A DREADFUL SNOWSTORM
SHE MUST NOT HEAR OF HER POWER FROM US
SHE TOOK THE LITTLE MAIDEN ON HER ARM AND BOTH FLEW IN BRIGHTNESS AND IN JOY SO HIGH SO VERY HIGH AND THEN ABOVE WAS NEITHER COLD NOR HUNGER NOR ANXIETY--THEY WERE WITH GOD
BUT THE LITTLE FIR WANTED SO VERY MUCH TO BE A GROWN-UP TREE
AND NOW THE EMPEROR HIMSELF WISHED TO SEE THE COSTLY MANUFACTURE WHILE IT WAS STILL IN THE LOOM
HE FOUND HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE MANY CIRCUMJACENT MOUNTAIN-RIDGES WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED BY MEANS OF DR MADLER'S MAP OF THE MOON WITHIN DOWN IT SUNK PERPENDICULARLY INTO A CALDRON ABOUT A DANISH MILE IN DEPTH
HE LAUGHED AND THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND NOW SHE HAD NOT TIME TO KILL GERDA
YES INDEED SAID THE LADY
THE ROBE OF THE ONE WAS RED THAT OF THE SECOND BLUE AND THAT OF THE THIRD WHITE
WOULD THAT HIS BEARD SHOULD NOT GROW FOR IN THAT CASE HE WILL LEAVE US IN THE EVENING THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW DANCED TOGETHER IN THE LARGE BALL-ROOM
YOU WILL DIE I SUPPOSE
AND SHE TOLD HER NOT TO BE CAST DOWN BUT TASTE HER CHERRIES AND LOOK AT HER FLOWERS WHICH WERE FINER THAN ANY IN A PICTURE-BOOK EACH OF WHICH COULD TELL A WHOLE STORY
THEY ARE AS EXACT AS POSSIBLE
YOU CERTAINLY KNOW THAT EVERY PERSON HAS HIS OR HER LIFE'S TREE OR FLOWER JUST AS EVERYONE HAPPENS TO BE SETTLED
I AM IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THERE CAME A SORT OF DESIRE OVER ME TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE BEFORE YOU DIE
NO ONE HAD GIVEN HER A SINGLE FARTHING
TO THE FIR THAT WOULD BE A REAL CHARMING PRINCESS
THE SHOEMAKER SAID ALSO THEY HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE CHILD OF A COUNT BUT HAD NOT FITTED
BUT HAS HE SOLID KNOWLEDGE
THERE IS NOTHING ELSE FOR IT
ASTONISHED AT WHAT HE SAW THE COUNCILLOR ASKED WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MUMMERY AND WHO THAT MAN WAS
AT LENGTH THE CARRIAGE STOPPED
THEY COULD NOT GET THE MASTERY OVER THEM--IT WAS A WHOLE FOREST OF BURDOCKS
WHEN WE DIE--SO AT LEAST SAYS THE STUDENT FOR WHOM MY WIFE DOES THE WASHING--WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER
I CAN TELL THINGS
DOES SHE NOT SHOW US--SHE THE QUEEN IN THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT--HER ASTOUNDING DRAMATIC TALENT IN ALL OUR DREAMS
IT WAS HIS OWN ROOM
WHEN YOU ARE OLD YOU RECEIVE A PENSION TRUE SAID THE CLERK SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
SOME VAST OBJECT SEEMED TO BE THROWN OVER HIM
SOME OF THE CLEVEREST IT IS TRUE HAD TAKEN BREAD AND BUTTER WITH THEM
WHERE ONE DANCES ABOUT ON TALLOW CANDLES
BUT PLACE YOURSELF HERE AND WHEN DEATH COMES--I EXPECT HIM EVERY MOMENT--DO NOT LET HIM PLUCK THE FLOWER UP BUT THREATEN HIM THAT YOU WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHERS
FOR AS SOON AS THEY GOT ASTRIDE IT THE ROUND POLISHED KNOB WAS TURNED INTO A MAGNIFICENT NEIGHING HEAD A LONG BLACK MANE FLUTTERED IN THE BREEZE AND FOUR SLENDER YET STRONG LEGS SHOT OUT
SHOULD I REALLY BE CURED
FOR MANY A YEAR HAVE I NOT FELT AS AT THIS MOMENT WE SEE ALREADY BY THE FOREGOING EFFUSION THAT HE IS BECOME A POET
AND UNFORTUNATELY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM TO WISH HIMSELF FREE
THEN LITTLE GERDA CRIED AND TOLD HER HER WHOLE HISTORY AND ALL THAT THE RAVENS HAD DONE FOR HER
WE WILL GO STRAIGHT ON FOR WE SHALL MEET NO ONE I THINK THERE IS SOMEBODY JUST BEHIND US SAID GERDA
OH HOW DARK AND COMFORTLESS IT WAS IN THE DREARY WORLD
BUT NOW YOU KNOW HIM AND YOU KNOW TOO HOW ILL-BEHAVED HE IS
BUT I KNOW THE WOOD WHERE THE SUN SHINES AND WHERE THE LITTLE BIRDS SING AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH
THEY BOTH BENT OVER THE CORPSE
THEY WERE CERTAINLY FAR HANDSOMER THAN THOSE DAME SHOEMAKER HAD MADE FOR LITTLE KAREN
HAD I BUT REJOICED WHEN I HAD REASON TO DO SO
THERE STOOD THE LITTLE CHILDREN'S CHAIRS AND KAY AND GERDA SAT DOWN ON THEM HOLDING EACH OTHER BY THE HAND
BE REASONABLE OR I WILL CALL THE GUARD I WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE PRINCESS SAID THE LEARNED MAN
A KNIGHT WITH A GLEAMING PLUME AND MOST MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED HELD HIM BEFORE HIM ON THE HORSE AND THUS THEY RODE THROUGH THE WOOD TO THE OLD TOWN OF BORDINGBORG AND THAT WAS A LARGE AND VERY LIVELY TOWN
SOME WILD BUSHES STOOD UP HERE AND THERE WHILE ACROSS THE FIELD FLOWED A BROAD CANAL OR RIVER
THEN LITTLE GERDA SHED BURNING TEARS
THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER FROM THE CROWN OF THE HEAD TO THE SOLES OF THE FEET
AND HE HAD JUST BEEN MARRIED AND TOGETHER WITH HIS LITTLE WIFE HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE HERE WHERE THE GARDEN WAS
THEN THE SMITH MUST BE FETCHED TO FILE AWAY THE BARS
THE ROSES HAVE BEEN IN THE EARTH AND THEY SAY NO DING DONG SOUNDED THE HYACINTH BELLS
AND THE LITTLE GIRL ALWAYS SANG TO HIM THIS YOU WILL NEVER FORGET AND DURING THEIR WHOLE FLIGHT THE ELDER TREE SMELT SO SWEET AND ODOROUS
AS WE HAVE NOW BECOME COMPANIONS AND IN THIS WAY HAVE GROWN UP TOGETHER FROM CHILDHOOD SHALL WE NOT DRINK THOU TOGETHER IT IS MORE FAMILIAR YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE SHADOW WHO WAS NOW THE PROPER MASTER
I FIND IT SO VERY DELIGHTFUL HERE AND THEN ALL THE OLD THOUGHTS WITH WHAT THEY MAY BRING WITH THEM THEY COME AND VISIT HERE YES IT'S ALL VERY WELL BUT I SEE NOTHING OF THEM AND I DON'T KNOW THEM SAID THE PEWTER SOLDIER
TEMPLE HE NOW CREPT ON HANDS AND FEET THROUGH A BUTCHER'S SHOP
DON'T YOU KNOW ME
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CONSIDERED THE MOST ABSENT MAN IN THE WHOLE KINGDOM AND PEOPLE TOLD THE DROLLEST ANECDOTES ABOUT HIM
HE FOUND WHOLE FIGURES WHICH REPRESENTED A WRITTEN WORD
SECOND STORY
HE PERCHED UPON THE TABLE
ONE DAY THERE WAS A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN
AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT INTO THE COURT-YARD HE MOVED VERY SOFTLY AND THE LADIES WERE SO MUCH ENGROSSED WITH COUNTING THE KISSES THAT ALL MIGHT GO ON FAIRLY THAT THEY DID NOT PERCEIVE THE EMPEROR
AND AS NEITHER THE LIEUTENANT NOR ANYBODY ELSE IN THE STREET CLAIMED THEM AS HIS PROPERTY THEY WERE DELIVERED OVER TO THE POLICE-OFFICE AS ON THE CONTINENT IN ALL LAW AND POLICE PRACTICES NOTHING IS VERBAL BUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER TRIFLING IS REDUCED TO WRITING THE LABOR AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT THUS ACCUMULATE IS ENORMOUS
AND THE OLD CLOCK IN THE CORNER BURRED AND BURRED THE GREAT LEADEN WEIGHT RAN DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUMP
SO HE PUT THEM ON
I AM IN MY PRIME AND AM ONLY RATHER SHORT FOR MY AGE WHAT DELIGHTFUL STORIES YOU KNOW SAID THE MICE
QUICKER HOWEVER THAN THE BREEZE THE WITHERED SALLOW ARMS OF THE BEGGARS WERE THRUST IN ACCOMPANIED BY THE ETERNAL WHINE OF MISERABILI MISERABILI EXCELLENZA ON THE WALLS WERE DISPLAYED INNUMERABLE INSCRIPTIONS WRITTEN IN NEARLY EVERY LANGUAGE OF EUROPE SOME IN VERSE SOME IN PROSE MOST OF THEM NOT VERY LAUDATORY OF BELLA ITALIA THE MEAL WAS SERVED
WITHIN SOUNDED A PSALM
I FLEW AROUND WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND OVER THE GLASSY LAKES WHERE THE BRIGHT WATER-PLANTS NODDED TO ME FROM BELOW
BUT IN THE SONG THERE WAS NO POETRY FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE POET WAS GONE
TIS GOLD THEY CRIED
IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT BE THE BISHOP
WERE THE SALOONS LIKE THE STARLIT FIRMAMENT WHEN WE STAND ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS EVERYTHING WAS THERE SAID THE SHADOW
AND THE ORGAN PLAYED AND THE FOUNTAINS RUSTLED
WHERE THE DEUCE CAN THE HOUSE BE
TWO FAIRIES WERE THEY
YOUR READING IN THE ANCIENTS IS SINE DUBIO OF VAST EXTENT OH YES I'VE READ SOMETHING TO BE SURE REPLIED THE COUNCILLOR
IT WAS A WOODEN BIRD THE POPINJAY USED AT THE SHOOTING-MATCHES AT PRASTOE
YES THAT WAS LITTLE TUK
AND SHE DANCED AND MUST DANCE OVER FIELDS AND MEADOWS IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE BY NIGHT AND DAY
BUT WHEN HE CAME BACK AGAIN INTO THE ROOM IT WAS QUITE DARK AND AS TO A LIGHT THERE WAS NO THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING
BUT NOBODY CAME TO FETCH THE SHOES
I KNOW THE DATE SAID SHE
AND SHE PLAYED IT WITH ONE FINGER
THE CARVED TRUMPETERS BLEW TRATERATRA
AND THEY FELL ON HIS BOSOM THEY PENETRATED TO HIS HEART THEY THAWED THE LUMPS OF ICE AND CONSUMED THE SPLINTERS OF THE LOOKING-GLASS
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED
WHAT LOVELY SUMMER-DAYS THOSE WERE
IT WAS LATE IN THE AUTUMN BUT THAT ONE COULD NOT REMARK IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN WHERE THERE WAS ALWAYS SUNSHINE AND WHERE THERE WERE FLOWERS THE WHOLE YEAR ROUND
I HAVE NO SHADOW
O MIGHTY DEATH
DEATH WILL SOON COME AND PLANT THEM OVER AGAIN
THE COCKS ARE FLYING UP FROM KJOGE
THAT'S NOT WORTH TALKING ABOUT SAID THE RAVEN OF THE WOODS
THAT ABOUT IVEDY-AVEDY OR ABOUT HUMPY-DUMPY WHO TUMBLED DOWNSTAIRS AND YET AFTER ALL CAME TO THE THRONE AND MARRIED THE PRINCESS IVEDY-AVEDY CRIED SOME
IT WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK AND OF THE VERY FINEST CLOTH
THEY ARE NOT TALLER THAN I
ON THEY FLEW OVER WOODS AND LAKES OVER SEAS AND MANY LANDS
HE ROVES ABOUT IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE AND UPON THE RAMPARTS
THE WHOLE WEEK SHE WAS UNHAPPY AND WEPT MANY BITTER TEARS
THE GLASS THAT WAS STICKING IN HIS HEART WHICH MADE HIM TEASE EVEN LITTLE GERDA WHOSE WHOLE SOUL WAS DEVOTED TO HIM
PEOPLE THAT SAW HIM SAID WHAT A FINE TREE AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
YET SHE LIVES ONLY IN IMAGINATION
INDEED HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT BEFORE HE WAS EXACTLY UNDER IT AND HIS EYES FELL UPON THE BRIGHT COLORS OF THE PICTURES WHICH REPRESENTED THE WELL-KNOWN GROUP OF THE VIRGIN AND THE INFANT JESUS
FOR SHE SPOKE LOUD ENOUGH AND YOU WERE LISTENING THE REINDEER GAVE A BOUND FOR JOY
THEY SLEPT
GERDA CALLED STILL LOUDER AND AN OLD WOMAN THEN CAME OUT OF THE COTTAGE LEANING UPON A CROOKED STICK
OR IN FACT WHAT IT WAS TO BE BOILED AND TO LIE ON A SILVER DISH THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY IMAGINE
THE LEAP-FROG SAID NOTHING
EVERY FLOWER THAT ONE COULD THINK OF AND OF EVERY SEASON STOOD THERE IN FULLEST BLOOM
THEY LAID HOLD OF HIM BY THE LEGS
WHEN SHE HAD UNROLLED IT STRANGE CHARACTERS WERE TO BE SEEN WRITTEN THEREON
HE EVEN FOUND THE IDEA ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE
THEY WERE NOW ON THE STAIRS
NO ONE HAD THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF WHAT BEAUTIFUL THINGS SHE HAD SEEN
SCARCELY TRUSTING HIS SENSES THE NOCTURNAL WANDERER DISCOVERED A SHALLOW PIECE OF WATER AND HERE FELL IN WITH TWO MEN WHO VERY COMFORTABLY WERE ROCKING TO AND FRO IN A BOAT
YOUR TALE IS VERY AFFECTING
CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD MAN NOW CAME WITH A DRAWER IN WHICH THERE WAS MUCH TO BE SEEN BOTH TIN BOXES AND BALSAM BOXES OLD CARDS SO LARGE AND SO GILDED SUCH AS ONE NEVER SEES THEM NOW
THEY WERE NAMELY CASTS OF FEMALE FRIENDS WHOSE BODILY OR MENTAL DEFORMITIES WERE HERE MOST FAITHFULLY PRESERVED
THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD-RED STAMINA SKYBLUE TULIPS WHICH SHONE AS THEY WAVED IN THE WINDS AND APPLE-TREES THE APPLES OF WHICH LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE LARGE SOAPBUBBLES
HE HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN PATH AND HAD REACHED THE SPOT JUST AS SOON AS THE SON OF THE KING HAD DONE
THEY IMAGINED IT WAS THE REAL HEART OF THE UNIVERSE OR PLANETARY SYSTEM ON WHICH THE GENUINE COSMOPOLITES OR CITIZENS OF THE WORLD DWELT
AND THE OLD FEMALE ROBBER JUMPED ABOUT SO THAT IT WAS QUITE DREADFUL FOR GERDA TO SEE HER
HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE-COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN--WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
BUT NOW IT'S COMING
THEY PRAISED THE RAVENS VERY MUCH AND TOLD THEM THEY WERE NOT AT ALL ANGRY WITH THEM BUT THEY WERE NOT TO DO SO AGAIN
THE SUN NOW SET
THE SUN NOW SET
BUT AT NIGHT IT WAS THE MOST FEARFUL
HIS BOOTS CREAKED TOO SO LOUDLY BUT STILL HE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID THAT'S KAY FOR CERTAIN SAID GERDA
BUT OLD DAME SNAIL MADE A BRILLIANT SPEECH
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS CALLED KAREN
IT IS OF NO USE ASKING THE FLOWERS
WHITHER ARE THEY TAKEN WE KNOW
THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED
NOW HE SAID THAT THERE WERE JUST AS MANY INHABITANTS AS HE HAD NAILS IN HIS BODY
IT MUST BE HERE ON THIS VERY SPOT
WE THEREFORE WISH HIM JOY OF THE EXCURSION WITH ALL OUR HEART
HE AND ALL SENSIBLE FOLKS WERE OBLIGED TO STAY WITHIN DOORS--THE WINDOW-SHUTTERS AND DOORS WERE CLOSED THE WHOLE DAY
HE HAD A DIFFERENT SUIT FOR EACH HOUR OF THE DAY
THEY WERE LAID ON CARTS AND THE HORSES DREW THEM OUT OF THE WOOD
BUT LET ME FIND WHEN YOU ENJOY HONOR AND DISTINCTION THAT YOU POSSESS A GRATEFUL HEART TUT
WILL YOU GO WITH ME AS SHADOW
FLY MY FRIEND
THEIR FORMS WERE TOO NOBLE FOR THAT THEIR SKIN TOO FINE THE CUT OF THEIR DRESS TOO STRIKING
THAT BOOK IS NOT WRITTEN BY A HEIBERG BUT WAS IMPRINTED BY GODFREY VON GEHMEN OH IS THAT THE AUTHOR'S NAME SAID THE COUNCILLOR
THE DOGS CAME LEAPING ALONG AND WHOLE FLOCKS OF WILD-FOWL FLEW OVER THE CAIRN WHERE BLACKBERRY-BUSHES WERE HANGING ROUND THE OLD STONES
THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED FOR MOURNING BUT SHE HAD NO OTHERS AND WITH STOCKINGLESS FEET SHE FOLLOWED THE POOR STRAW COFFIN IN THEM
HE WALKED IN
THAT IS WHAT I SAY AND IT IS RIGHT
A FREEZING COLD THOUGH OF SHORT DURATION PERVADED THE WHOLE CREATION
OH WHAT WOULD I NOT GIVE TO COME TO MY CHILD SAID THE WEEPING MOTHER
AND WHEN THE LIGHTS IN THE PALACE HAD ALL GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED THE RAVEN LED LITTLE GERDA TO THE BACK DOOR WHICH STOOD HALF OPEN
THE POOR WATCHMAN OUT THERE IN THE STREET IS FAR HAPPIER THAN I
LISTEN
AND HE STOOD BY HER THERE WHILST SHE PLANTED A FIELD-FLOWER THAT SHE FOUND SO PRETTY
LISTEN MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE SHADOW TO THE LEARNED MAN
I WAS IN WANT OF BOOTS OF CLOTHES OF THE WHOLE HUMAN VARNISH THAT MAKES A MAN PERCEPTIBLE
THE RAVEN IS DEAD SHE ANSWERED
YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT AND I SHALL REMEMBER IT
IV
NOW THEN I SHALL REALLY ENJOY LIFE SAID HE EXULTINGLY AND SPREAD OUT HIS BRANCHES
DO I INSTEAD OF MOUNTING ONLY SINK
HE WANTED TO BE A POET AND HE WAS ONE
SO LARGE WERE THEY
WE KNOW WHITHER THEY ARE TAKEN
THAT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN REAL FLOWERS
WHO ALMOST TEAR ME TO PIECES FOR SHEER LOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND NODDED
IT SMELT SO SWEET THAT ALL CARES AND SORROWS WERE FORGOTTEN BY HIM WHO INHALED ITS FRAGRANCE
THE YOUNG SANG SONGS BUT THE OLD TOLD FAIRY TALES OF MOUNTAIN-SPRITES AND SOOTHSAYERS
IT WOULD AT LEAST BE A CHANGE
IT WAS CRACKED IN A THOUSAND PIECES BUT EACH PIECE WAS SO LIKE THE OTHER THAT IT SEEMED THE WORK OF A CUNNING ARTIFICER
I WILL TELL YOU AS WELL AS I CAN
SO THE TWO PRETENDED WEAVERS SET UP TWO LOOMS AND AFFECTED TO WORK VERY BUSILY THOUGH IN REALITY THEY DID NOTHING AT ALL
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE SEEN
THE EARTH IS HARD AND COVERED WITH SNOW
TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT LITTLE MARY
IN ONE OF THE HOUSES NOT FAR FROM THE NEW MARKET A PARTY WAS INVITED--A VERY LARGE PARTY IN ORDER AS IS OFTEN THE CASE TO GET A RETURN INVITATION FROM THE OTHERS
I THINK MY SHADOW IS THE ONLY LIVING THING ONE SEES OVER THERE SAID THE LEARNED MAN
THEREFORE FLY AWAY
SHE THEN CAME TO A LARGE LAKE WHERE THERE WAS NEITHER SHIP NOR BOAT
PERHAPS HE WILL AMUSE MY GOOD POLLY ADDED THE LADY LOOKING WITH A BENIGNANT SMILE AT A LARGE GREEN PARROT THAT SWUNG HIMSELF BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS MOST COMFORTABLY IN HIS RING INSIDE A MAGNIFICENT BRASS-WIRED CAGE
IF A SECOND THEN IT BLOWS PRETTY STIFFLY
TIS WELL FOR NOW YOU CAN OBSERVE THEM IN BED ALL THE BETTER
AND THE WOOD AND THE SEA SANG A SONG OF REJOICING AND HIS HEART SANG WITH THE REST
AND WHO HAS HELPED YOU OUR LORD HAS HELPED ME SAID SHE
BUT IT WAS SAID TO BE DELIGHTFUL AND PARTICULARLY GENTEEL
IT WAS A GLORIOUS PROSPECT
IT WAS TO ASK IF THE LITTLE BOY HIMSELF HAD NOT A WISH TO COME OVER AND PAY A VISIT
IT WAS BELIEVED AT LAST HE WOULD NOT JUMP AT ALL
BUT NO ONE CAME IN
I FEEL QUITE HOT
COME LET US BE MEN POOR LITTLE DANISH GREY-BIRD SAID THE CANARY
OH IT WAS WONDROUS BEAUTIFUL
A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
AND OLD GRANNY SAT IN THE TREE AND LOOKED AS PLEASED AS NOW
SHE DESPISES THE WHOLE WORLD
THERE SAT THE POOR LITTLE FELLOW WITH HIS SISTER ON HIS LAP AND HE SANG TO HER ALL THE SONGS HE KNEW
THEY HAD NO EDUCATION AND TALKED OF WHATEVER CAME INTO THEIR HEAD
HE NOW ENDEAVORED AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE TO DISPEL HIS GLOOM WHICH WAS CAUSED BY OUTWARD CHANCE CIRCUMSTANCES MERELY AND ON THE BOSOM OF NATURE IMBIBE THE MILK OF PUREST HUMAN ENJOYMENT
I WILL GIVE YOU A FEW WORDS FROM ME WHICH I WILL WRITE ON A DRIED HABERDINE FOR PAPER I HAVE NONE
COO
COO
YOUR HOUSE WILL EXALT ITSELF LIKE KING WALDEMAR'S TOWER AND WILL BE RICHLY DECORATED WITH MARBLE STATUES LIKE THAT AT PRASTOE
THE HEALTHIEST OF THEM RESEMBLED TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF MARRYAT'S HUNGER'S ELDEST SON WHEN HE HAD COME OF AGE
HE MOVED HIS HEAD BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND FLEW AWAY
WOULD YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SEND FOR A HACKNEY-COACH TO TAKE ME TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD
THAT'S A HAPPY FELLOW
AM I TO HEAR A FAIRY TALE ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
OH WOULD IT WERE ALWAYS SPRING IN THE SWEETLY-SMELLING DANISH BEECH-FORESTS ASPERULA ODORATA
IN IT I READ THAT YOU WERE IN WARM LANDS WHERE THE COFFEE-TREE GROWS
BUT THERE WOULD ALSO BE SOME GOOD STATELY SHOPS AMONG THEM
AND THE FINLAND WOMAN READ AT SUCH A RATE THAT THE PERSPIRATION TRICKLED DOWN HER FOREHEAD
IT MUST BE QUITE A NEW ONE THAT HEIBERG HAS PUBLISHED LATELY NO ANSWERED THE THEOLOGIAN OF THE TIME OF KING HANS
THEN CAME THE WARM BOX-IRON
YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHITE HAIR INSTEAD AND THAT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING DO YOU DEMAND NOTHING ELSE SAID SHE
IT WAS JUST AS IF SOMEBODY WAS SNEEZING
YOU ARE A NOBLE CHARACTER SAID THE PRINCESS
YET I AM WILLING TO SUSPEND MY JUDICIUM MAY I ASK WITH WHOM I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SPEAKING ASKED THE COUNCILLOR
I SHALL NOT SAY TO ANYONE WHO THOU ACTUALLY ART
AND ON THE FLOOR STOOD THE TAME RAVEN TURNING HER HEAD ON EVERY SIDE AND LOOKING AT GERDA WHO BOWED AS HER GRANDMOTHER HAD TAUGHT HER TO DO
HER EYES WERE QUITE BLACK
IN THE EVENING HE WENT OUT AGAIN ON THE BALCONY
ONLY ASK THE REINDEER WHO IS TETHERED THERE ICE AND SNOW IS THERE
TO TRAVEL
HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM TO OUR LORD AND NO ONE DARES TO PLUCK THEM UP BEFORE HE GIVES LEAVE ALL AT ONCE AN ICY COLD RUSHED THROUGH THE GREAT HALL AND THE BLIND MOTHER COULD FEEL THAT IT WAS DEATH THAT CAME
BLESSED SPIRITS FLOATED AROUND THEM AND LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES IN A REJOICING HALLELUJAH
I JUMPED THE HIGHEST
AND AMONG OTHER PIECES TO BE RECITED WAS A NEW POEM BY H
SHE CALLED HIM QUITE LOUD BY NAME HELD THE LAMP TOWARDS HIM--THE DREAMS RUSHED BACK AGAIN INTO THE CHAMBER--HE AWOKE TURNED HIS HEAD AND--IT WAS NOT LITTLE KAY
MASTER AND MISTRESS SAY THOU TO THEIR SERVANTS THE SUPERIOR TO THE INFERIOR
SHE PUTS IT ON TIES A SAFFRON-COLORED KERCHIEF ROUND HER NECK AND THEN THE GOWN LOOKS WHITER
THERE WAS A CRUSH AND A HURRY BUT NO ONE WAS SUCCESSFUL EITHER ON THE FIRST OR SECOND DAY
HE MUST BE EXAMINED SO SHE BEGAN BY DEGREES TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS SHE COULD THINK OF AND WHICH SHE HERSELF COULD NOT HAVE ANSWERED
THE BURDOCK NEVER GROWS ALONE BUT WHERE THERE GROWS ONE THERE ALWAYS GROW SEVERAL
ONE MIGHT INDEED WELL BE ABASHED
IT IS ONLY A HUNDRED HUMAN PACES WELL THEN LET HER COME TO HIM SAID THE OLD ONES
HAD I WRITTEN A NEWSPAPER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN READ
WHERE WAS THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE
IN THE WARM LANDS EVERY WINDOW HAS A BALCONY AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ON ALL THE BALCONIES IN THE STREET--FOR ONE MUST HAVE AIR EVEN IF ONE BE ACCUSTOMED TO BE MAHOGANY IT WAS LIVELY BOTH UP AND DOWN THE STREET
BUT I LAUGHED TO MYSELF AND THEN I FELL OFF THE TABLE AND GOT A BUMP WHICH I HAVE STILL--FOR IT WAS NOT RIGHT OF ME TO LAUGH
THE WAR OF THE BUCCANEERS OF 1490 WAS SO RECENT THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL BEING ALLUDED TO
IN VAIN ONE WAVED MYRTLE-BRANCHES ABOUT LIKE MAD
I AM VERY WELL OFF THEN HE TOOK A BOOK WITH PICTURES IN IT DOWN FROM THE SHELF
IN A CORNER FORMED BY TWO HOUSES OF WHICH ONE ADVANCED MORE THAN THE OTHER SHE SEATED HERSELF DOWN AND COWERED TOGETHER
A FALLING STAR SHONE IN THE DARK FIRMAMENT
THERE WERE THREE THEREFORE THAT DID NOT GO
MANY SAD TEARS WERE SHED AND LITTLE GERDA WEPT LONG AND BITTERLY
IT MAY POSSIBLY BE HOWEVER THAT IT IS THE SAME PEWTER SOLDIER SAID SHE
NOW WHICH WILL YOU HAVE
THERE STOOD HIS DISCHARGE WRITTEN IN RESPLENDENT MASSES OF ICE
FOR SHE WAS ANGRY
THE LAKE WAS NOT FROZEN SUFFICIENTLY TO BEAR HER
ACCOMPANIED BY A SELECT NUMBER OF OFFICERS OF THE COURT AMONG WHOM WERE THE TWO HONEST MEN WHO HAD ALREADY ADMIRED THE CLOTH HE WENT TO THE CRAFTY IMPOSTORS WHO AS SOON AS THEY WERE AWARE OF THE EMPEROR'S APPROACH WENT ON WORKING MORE DILIGENTLY THAN EVER
SO THEY OFTEN OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GET OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO EACH OTHER AND TO SIT ON THEIR LITTLE STOOLS AMONG THE ROSES WHERE THEY COULD PLAY DELIGHTFULLY
THE LEARNED MAN FROM THE COLD LANDS--HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND SEEMED TO BE A CLEVER MAN--SAT IN A GLOWING OVEN
BUT THEN SHE MUST BE A REAL PRINCESS
HIS LITTLE SISTER AUGUSTA SHE WITH THE BLUE EYES AND THE FAIR CURLING HAIR WAS SUDDENLY A TALL BEAUTIFUL GIRL AND WITHOUT HAVING WINGS WAS YET ABLE TO FLY
THERE WAS NO RAILWAY EITHER
TELL ME THE WAY AND I SHALL FIND HIM I KNOW IT SAID THE WOMAN IN THE BLACK CLOTHES
HERE AND THERE STOOD AN APPLE AND A PLUM-TREE OR ELSE ONE NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A GARDEN
AND DEATH STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG HAND TOWARDS THE FINE LITTLE FLOWER BUT SHE HELD HER HANDS FAST AROUND HIS SO TIGHT AND YET AFRAID THAT SHE SHOULD TOUCH ONE OF THE LEAVES
NOW THE TREE DID NOT EVEN DARE TREMBLE
THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURE WHY THERE IS A PAIR OF GALOSHES AS SURE AS I'M ALIVE SAID THE WATCHMAN AWAKING FROM A GENTLE SLUMBER
POOR LITTLE THING SAID THE PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS
THE FRAGRANCE GREW STRONGER--THREE COFFINS AND IN THEM THREE LOVELY MAIDENS GLIDED OUT OF THE FOREST AND ACROSS THE LAKE
TO-MORROW I SHALL HEAR AGAIN THE STORY OF HUMPY-DUMPY AND PERHAPS THAT OF IVEDY-AVEDY TOO AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
ALAS SIGHED HE I KNOW ONE IN WHICH ALL IS STATELY
WE HAVE BEEN IN THE EARTH WHERE ALL THE DEAD ARE BUT KAY WAS NOT THERE MANY THANKS SAID LITTLE GERDA
THE SEA WAS DARK BLUE COVERED WITH SHIPS FULL OF WHITE SAILS
AND SEWED WITH NEEDLES WITHOUT ANY THREAD IN THEM
HEAR HOW IT BEATS LIKE A DRUM ON THE DOCK-LEAVES SAID FATHER SNAIL
AND PRETENDED TO BE CARRYING SOMETHING
AND DOORS AND WINDOWS CUT OUT OF THE BODY OF THE QUEEN OF HEARTS
AND THERE SHE MAY REMAIN THE BELL PEOPLE SAID THE EVENING BELL IS SOUNDING THE SUN IS SETTING FOR A STRANGE WONDROUS TONE WAS HEARD IN THE NARROW STREETS OF A LARGE TOWN
WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN
AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE-BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE AND IF HIS GRANDMOTHER TOLD THEM STORIES HE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HER
SO SHE STOOD STILL LOOKED AT THE LONG YELLOW FLOWER AND ASKED YOU PERHAPS KNOW SOMETHING AND SHE BENT DOWN TO THE NARCISSUS
MY OWN HAIR-COMB WAS IN LOVE WITH ME SHE LOST ALL HER TEETH FROM THE HEART-ACHE
TWO LITTLE GIRLS SAT DOWN AND TWINED GARLANDS SO THEY DID NOT GO EITHER
BUT YOU NEVER CAME
HERE WHERE HANNIBAL DEFEATED FLAMINIUS THE RIVERS NOW HELD EACH OTHER IN THEIR GREEN EMBRACES
IT WAS PAINTED QUITE WHITE AND THERE WAS SOMEONE IN IT WRAPPED UP IN A ROUGH WHITE MANTLE OF FUR WITH A ROUGH WHITE FUR CAP ON HIS HEAD
THAT POWER LIES IN HER HEART BECAUSE SHE IS A SWEET AND INNOCENT CHILD
THE WHITE DOVE OF INNOCENCE FLUTTERED OVER THE ALTAR
AND AS THEY HAD NO CHILDREN THEMSELVES THEY HAD ADOPTED A LITTLE COMMON SNAIL WHICH THEY BROUGHT UP AS THEIR OWN
HOWEVER SHE SAID NOT A WORD OF WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
BUT HE THOUGHT THE PROCESSION MUST GO ON NOW
AFTER ALL THAT WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT DISAGREEABLE DREAM THAT HAUNTED ME
HERE IS MY HAND--I PROMISE IT AND A MAN'S BOND IS HIS WORD A WORD IS A SHADOW SAID THE SHADOW AND AS SUCH IT MUST SPEAK IT WAS REALLY QUITE ASTONISHING HOW MUCH OF A MAN IT WAS
OH YOU WERE SO DASHING
TIS TRUE LITTLE KAY IS AT THE SNOW QUEEN'S AND FINDS EVERYTHING THERE QUITE TO HIS TASTE
THEN THE MOTHER WRUNG HER HANDS SANG AND WEPT AND THERE WERE MANY SONGS BUT YET MANY MORE TEARS
OR THE DAY OF REPENTANCE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR BORNHOLMISH DIALECT SAID HE AT LAST ANGRILY AND TURNING HIS BACK UPON THEM
THEY LOOKED SO VERY OLD
THE OTHERS HASTENED ON
TIS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD
AND SUDDENLY THE ATMOSPHERE GREW AS BLUE AGAIN AS BEFORE
HOWEVER IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH AND THEN HE TOLD ALL HE KNEW
THE OLD COUNCILLOR WHO HAD HAD THREE ORDERS GIVEN HIM TO MAKE HIM HOLD HIS TONGUE ASSERTED THAT THE LEAP-FROG WAS A PROPHET
DO YOU KNOW ONLY ONE STORY ASKED THE RATS
I REMEMBER IT QUITE WELL
AND THE FIRST THING THAT WAS DONE HERE WAS NATURALLY TO PULL OFF THE GALOSHES--WHEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS MERELY GONE OUT ON ADVENTURES MUST HAVE RETURNED WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LIGHTNING TO ITS EARTHLY TENEMENT
THUS PASSED THE FIRST MILES
THERE WAS ALSO THE FIRST OPERA DANCER SHE GAVE ME THAT CUT WHICH I NOW GO WITH SHE WAS SO FEROCIOUS
POOR LITTLE KAY SIGHED GERDA
I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT SO MYSELF
WITHIN WAS DANCE AND SONG AND KING WALDEMAR AND THE YOUNG RICHLY-ATTIRED MAIDS OF HONOR DANCED TOGETHER
HERE SIR SAID ONE OF THE MEN WHO PANTING BROUGHT HIM A TREMENDOUS PILE OF PAPERS
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SAID THEY
AT THE INVASION OF THE ENGLISH IN 1807 AN ENCOUNTER OF A NO VERY GLORIOUS NATURE TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE BRITISH TROOPS AND THE UNDISCIPLINED DANISH MILITIA
THE WHOLE CITY WAS ILLUMINATED IN THE EVENING AND THE CANNONS WENT OFF WITH A BUM
HERE IS THE SCARF
HE HAD LONG BEEN LOOKING AT GERDA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD
THEN WAS I RICH BUT NOT IN GOLD POOR ME
THERE AT ALL EVENTS ONE KNOWS WHAT ONE IS BREATHING THE WINDOWS WERE QUICKLY OPENED TO LET IN A LITTLE FRESH AIR
AND NOW HIS RECOLLECTION RETURNED FOR IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION HE HAD ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN ALL THAT HAD PRECEDED IT
THE BANKS ON BOTH SIDES WERE BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS THY CHILD'S FATE THOU SAW'ST--THY OWN CHILD'S FUTURE LIFE THEN THE MOTHER SCREAMED WITH TERROR WHICH OF THEM WAS MY CHILD
WILL YOU FLY ABOUT HERE AT LIBERTY ASKED THE PRINCESS
BUT IN THE AFTERNOON WE WENT UP THE ROUND TOWER AND LOOKED DOWN ON COPENHAGEN AND FAR FAR AWAY OVER THE WATER
MY DIZZINESS WOULD THEN CEASE
RATHER TAKE IT AWAY
WHO KNOWS PERHAPS I MAY FALL DOWNSTAIRS TOO AND GET A PRINCESS AS WIFE AND HE LOOKED FORWARD WITH JOY TO THE MORROW WHEN HE HOPED TO BE DECKED OUT AGAIN WITH LIGHTS PLAYTHINGS FRUITS AND TINSEL
THE ANXIETY I FEEL ABOUT THEM PREVENTS ME ENJOYING SWITZERLAND
WHAT THE BOTANIST TELLS US AFTER A NUMBER OF IMPERFECT LECTURES THE FLOWER PROCLAIMED IN A MINUTE
I MUST TELL THEE
I CANNOT BEAR IT LONGER
BUT THERE WAS NEITHER QUIET NOR REPOSE IN THEM
BUT NOW IT WAS ONLY TO THE HOT LANDS THAT A LEARNED MAN HAD COME FROM THE COLD
NO I AM GOING TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN TO LITTLE MARKET STREET BOTH MEN STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
THEY ARE ONLY DREAMS SAID THE RAVEN
YOU ARE CERTAINLY A GIRDLE SAID THE COLLAR
I MUST GO DOWN AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT SO HE PULLED UP HIS SLIPPERS AT THE HEEL FOR HE HAD TRODDEN THEM DOWN
I WOULD BEHOLD MAGNIFICENT SWITZERLAND
BUT IT IS FREEZINGLY COLD
THE COPYING-CLERK OR AS THE LADY SAID THE BROWN FIELD-BIRD WAS PUT INTO A SMALL CAGE CLOSE TO THE CANARY AND NOT FAR FROM MY GOOD POLLY THE ONLY HUMAN SOUNDS THAT THE PARROT COULD BAWL OUT WERE COME LET US BE MEN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HE SAID WAS AS UNINTELLIGIBLE TO EVERYBODY AS THE CHIRPING OF THE CANARY EXCEPT TO THE CLERK WHO WAS NOW A BIRD TOO
AND THERE HE SAT THE WHOLE DAY AND WORKED
AND THEY TOOK ELDER-BLOSSOMS FROM THEIR HAIR PLANTED THEM AND THEY GREW JUST LIKE THOSE THE OLD PEOPLE PLANTED WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN AS RELATED BEFORE
BUT YOU CAN GIVE ME YOUR LONG BLACK HAIR
IN THE COUNTRY THE VIOLIN SOUNDED IN THE ROOM OF THE PEASANT
RAG SAID THE BOX-IRON
BUT AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN HE FELT HIMSELF IN HIS NEW SITUATION MUCH LESS CONTENTED AND NOW PREFERRED THE VERY THING WHICH BUT SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE HAD REJECTED
I HAVE BEEN IN THE ANTECHAMBER AT THE COURT OF POESY BUT WHAT DID YOU SEE
THAT WOULD INDEED BE MARVELLOUS I WILL NOT SAY FOR A CERTAINTY THAT HE CAN SAID THE SHADOW BUT I THINK SO
NOBODY COULD GIVE ANY INTELLIGENCE
AND THE ROBBERS LAUGHED AND SAID LOOK HOW SHE IS DANCING WITH THE LITTLE ONE I WILL GO INTO THE CARRIAGE SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN
AND THEN CONTINUED THEIR PRETENDED WORK AT THE EMPTY LOOMS UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT
EACH OF THEM WAS A HUMAN LIFE THE HUMAN FRAME STILL LIVED--ONE IN CHINA AND ANOTHER IN GREENLAND--ROUND ABOUT IN THE WORLD
I CANNOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER YOU ARE GIVEN AWAY AS A PRESENT SAID THE LITTLE BOY
I ONLY WISH I WERE ALREADY ON THE UPPER BANK IN THESE RUSSIAN VAPOR BATHS THE PERSON EXTENDS HIMSELF ON A BANK OR FORM AND AS HE GETS ACCUSTOMED TO THE HEAT MOVES TO ANOTHER HIGHER UP TOWARDS THE CEILING WHERE OF COURSE THE VAPOR IS WARMEST
THAT'S WHERE THE WET FEET CAME FROM SAID THE OLD MAN
AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN
IT IS NOT MADE AT ALL IT IS NATURAL LET US SEE WHAT IS IN THE OTHER CASKET BEFORE WE GET INTO A BAD HUMOR SAID THE EMPEROR
THAT WAS A MARRIAGE
SO SHE PUT THE FISH INTO THE CUPBOARD--FOR IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE EATEN AND SHE NEVER THREW ANYTHING AWAY
SIT DOWN
IT WAS THAT IN WHICH THEY DWELT
THE NEXT DAY SHE WAS DRESSED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN SILK AND VELVET
THE CLEAR SUNSHINE STREAMED SO WARMLY THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE PEW WHERE KAREN SAT
ALAS POOR ME
ALAS POOR ME
NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARMING
SHE DANCED OVER THE CHURCHYARD BUT THE DEAD DID NOT DANCE--THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO DANCE
THEY WENT HAND IN HAND AS THE OLD PEOPLE HAD DONE WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN
I CAN SEE MYSELF--I CAN SEE MYSELF
IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE BEHOLD--THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IN THE WORLD TO WHICH ONE OUGHT NEVER TO GIVE UTTERANCE EXCEPT WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION
OH LET ME IN
YOU CAN I KNOW TWIST ALL THE WINDS OF THE WORLD TOGETHER IN A KNOT
THUS IT IS SAID THE LITTLE MAIDEN IN THE TREE SOME CALL ME OLD NANNY OTHERS A DRYAD BUT IN REALITY MY NAME IS REMEMBRANCE
SAVE MY CHILD FROM ALL THAT MISERY
THE NORTHERN-LIGHTS SHONE WITH SUCH PRECISION THAT ONE COULD TELL EXACTLY WHEN THEY WERE AT THEIR HIGHEST OR LOWEST DEGREE OF BRIGHTNESS
BUT HE IS CONFINED IS HE NOT THAT HE IS
HE CREPT GENTLY BEHIND THE CURTAIN BUT THE MAIDEN WAS GONE
OLD NANNY HAD GROWN ALL OF A SUDDEN A YOUNG AND PRETTY MAIDEN
TIS GOLD
BUT HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE
I AM NIGHT
THE GREEKS AND ROMANS SAID THE OLD MAN CALLED HER A DRYAD
TO IT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HEAVENLY BODIES IS NOT GREATER THAN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE HOMES OF OUR FRIENDS IN TOWN IS FOR US EVEN IF THEY LIVE A SHORT WAY FROM EACH OTHER
THE LEAP-FROG STOOD STILL FOR A LONG TIME LOST IN THOUGHT
AND THEN HE RATTLED A WHOLE BUNCH OF VALUABLE SEALS THAT HUNG TO HIS WATCH AND HE STUCK HIS HAND IN THE THICK GOLD CHAIN HE WORE AROUND HIS NECK--NAY
IT WAS JUST AS IF THE PEOPLE WITHIN WERE UNDER A CHARM AND HAD FALLEN INTO A TRANCE TILL THEY CAME OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
THE TITLE SUITED THE DRESS
CROAK SAID SHE
AND THEN THERE WAS A FLIGHT OF STAIRS WHICH WENT A GOOD WAY UPWARDS AND A LITTLE WAY DOWNWARDS AND THEN ONE CAME ON A BALCONY WHICH WAS IN A VERY DILAPIDATED STATE SURE ENOUGH WITH LARGE HOLES AND LONG CREVICES BUT GRASS GREW THERE AND LEAVES OUT OF THEM ALTOGETHER FOR THE WHOLE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE YARD AND THE WALLS WERE OVERGROWN WITH SO MUCH GREEN STUFF THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A GARDEN
GO IN AND ASK HIM THE PRICE OF THE INSTRUMENT
THE WINDOWS WERE VERY HIGH UP
THE SELENITES DISPUTED VARIOUSLY ABOUT OUR EARTH AND EXPRESSED THEIR DOUBTS IF IT COULD BE INHABITED
THE COUNCILLOR IMAGINED IT WAS THE CHOLERA THAT WAS MEANT WHICH PEOPLE MADE SO MUCH FUSS ABOUT
THEY BELONG TO MY CHILDHOOD'S LEARNING SAID THE SHADOW
WHO IS HUMPY-DUMPY ASKED THE MICE
ONE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED HE WAS FROZEN TO DEATH
AND IF THE COACHMAN GOT DOWN AND SCRAPED THEM OFF HARDLY A MINUTE ELAPSED BEFORE THEY WERE THERE AGAIN
WHERE SHALL I FIND MY LITTLE CHILD NAY I KNOW NOT SAID THE WOMAN AND YOU CANNOT SEE
A SINGLE LAMP WAS BURNING THERE
MAHOGANY
BUT SERVANTS AND INFERIORS DO NOT USE THE SAME TERM TO THEIR MASTERS OR SUPERIORS--NOR IS IT EVER USED WHEN SPEAKING TO A STRANGER OR ANYONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE BUT SLIGHTLY ACQUAINTED--THEY THEN SAY AS IN ENGLISH--YOU
IN OTHER PLACES THERE WAS A LITTLE DULL FLOWER IN RICH MOULD WITH MOSS ROUND ABOUT IT AND IT WAS SO PETTED AND NURSED
HAD YOU COME OVER THERE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MAN
NOT A CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE STREETS
DID THE OLD HEROES COMBAT THERE
HOW WELL YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT
WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IT EITHER ON RAILROADS OR IN BOATS WHEN CROSSING THE SEA
AND WHAT THE CHILD HAD SAID WAS WHISPERED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
IT WAS FIRST TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN THAT THEY BEGAN TO FRESHEN UP AGAIN
ASK HIM IF HE WILL HAVE TEN KISSES FROM THE LADIES OF MY COURT NO THANK YOU SAID THE SWINEHERD
THERE WAS A SORT OF TWILIGHT BUT THE ONE DOOR STOOD OPEN DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OTHER THROUGH A LONG ROW OF ROOMS AND SALOONS AND THERE IT WAS LIGHTED UP
AND IN ROESKILDE DO NOT FORGET THE DIET SAID KING HROAR
YOU NEED FEEL NO CARE FOR THE COMING MORROW
OF THE FLOWER-GARDEN AT THE OLD WOMAN'S WHO UNDERSTOOD WITCHCRAFT BUT WHAT BECAME OF LITTLE GERDA WHEN KAY DID NOT RETURN
AND EVERY FLAKE SEEMED LARGER AND APPEARED LIKE A MAGNIFICENT FLOWER OR BEAUTIFUL STAR
WHAT IS THAT SAID HE AS HE CAME OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE
BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER
A-HEM AND WHEN GERDA HAD TOLD HER EVERYTHING AND ASKED HER IF SHE HAD NOT SEEN LITTLE KAY THE WOMAN ANSWERED THAT HE HAD NOT PASSED THERE BUT HE NO DOUBT WOULD COME
BUT FOR THIS ONE MUST POSSESS UNDERSTANDING AND THE LEAP-FROG HAS SHOWN THAT HE HAS UNDERSTANDING
IT WOULD BE A REAL WORK OF CHARITY TO DELIVER HIM FROM THE LITTLE LIFE HE HAS AND WHEN I THINK PROPERLY OVER THE MATTER I AM OF OPINION THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DO AWAY WITH HIM IN ALL STILLNESS IT IS CERTAINLY HARD SAID THE SHADOW FOR HE WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT AND THEN HE GAVE A SORT OF SIGH
THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK AH
THIS TOOK PLACE AT HIS HOUSE IN HIS ROOM
THOSE WHO DO NOT LIKE HIM MAGNIFY IT SHRUG UP THEIR SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIM--THERE HE IS AGAIN
BUT THE EMPEROR HAS NOTHING AT ALL ON SAID A LITTLE CHILD
BUT WHAT HAPPENED FURTHER THEY KNEW NOT
IT IS REALLY DISGRACEFUL WHAT A STATE THIS PLACE IS IN MUTTERED HE TO HIMSELF
WHEN THE YOUNG MAIDENS COME FROM BEING EXAMINED BY THE CLERGYMAN OR GO TO CHURCH TO BE CONFIRMED THERE HE IS AGAIN CLOSE BEHIND THEM
YOU MUST GO TO A WATERING-PLACE SAID THE SHADOW WHO CAME AND VISITED HIM
WHILE SHE WAS EATING THE OLD WOMAN COMBED HER HAIR WITH A GOLDEN COMB AND HER HAIR CURLED AND SHONE WITH A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOR AROUND THAT SWEET LITTLE FACE WHICH WAS SO ROUND AND SO LIKE A ROSE
THE POOR ANIMAL KICKED
NOT EVEN A HARE
THE SUN IS GOING DOWN AND NIGHT IS COMING--THE DARK DARK NIGHT
TWO MILES HENCE THE GARDEN OF THE SNOW QUEEN BEGINS
THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURT-YARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID
THE NEXT MORNING HE HAD A SORE CHEST AND A BLEEDING BACK
I CANNOT SELL IT FOR LESS REJOINED THE SWINEHERD
AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR-KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY IF WITH A WHOLE SKIN HE WERE ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH THE RAILINGS
TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND BE TALL THOUGHT THE TREE--"THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD IN AUTUMN THE WOOD-CUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELLED SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES
THEY WOULD ALL FLY AWAY IMMEDIATELY IF THEY WERE NOT WELL FASTENED IN
I HAVE HEARD THEM BEFORE
THE FOREST WAS PLANTED FOR THEIR SAKE AND THE MANOR-HOUSE WAS THERE THAT THEY MIGHT BE BOILED AND LAID ON A SILVER DISH
THE LITTLE BOY COMES
ALL WERE LIGHTED UP BY THE POWERFUL AURORA BOREALIS AND ALL WERE SO LARGE SO EMPTY SO ICY COLD AND SO RESPLENDENT
IN SPRING WHEN THE SWALLOWS AND THE STORKS CAME THE TREE ASKED THEM DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN
THE LITTLE GIRL HAD ALREADY STRETCHED OUT HER FEET TO WARM THEM TOO
THEY ARE THEN DUUS BRODRE THOU BROTHERS AND EVER AFTERWARDS USE THE PRONOUN THOU TO EACH OTHER IT BEING REGARDED AS MORE FAMILIAR THAN DE YOU FATHER AND MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER SAY THOU TO ONE ANOTHER--WITHOUT REGARD TO AGE OR RANK
I WILL ADOPT HER AND KAREN BELIEVED ALL THIS HAPPENED ON ACCOUNT OF THE RED SHOES BUT THE OLD LADY THOUGHT THEY WERE HORRIBLE AND THEY WERE BURNT
SO THEY WENT INTO DEATH'S GREAT GREENHOUSE WHERE FLOWERS AND TREES GREW STRANGELY INTO ONE ANOTHER
TAKE IT INTO GOD'S KINGDOM
THEY ARE ALL MINE SAID SHE AT THE SAME TIME SEIZING ONE THAT WAS NEXT TO HER BY THE LEGS AND SHAKING IT SO THAT ITS WINGS FLUTTERED
THEY COME TO FETCH THE THOUGHTS OF THE HIGH PERSONAGES TO THE CHASE
BUT LITTLE TUK WAS NO LONGER LYING DOWN
THAT HE WAS ILL SHE COMPREHENDED DIRECTLY
FAREWELL
FAREWELL
THEY LOOK LIKE OTHER PLANTS BUT THEY HAVE PULSATIONS OF THE HEART
IT IS THE MOST GRACEFUL PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
SUDDENLY A LARGE OLD CARRIAGE DROVE UP AND A LARGE OLD LADY SAT IN IT
YOU HAVE BEEN CAUGHT TOO
I THOUGHT AS MUCH SAID THE FINE MAN
YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE A SHADOW SAID HIS FRIENDS TO HIM
THE GLASS WAS RED BLUE AND GREEN AND THE SUNLIGHT SHONE THROUGH QUITE WONDROUSLY IN ALL SORTS OF COLORS
A HUNDRED KISSES FROM THE PRINCESS SAID HE OR ELSE LET EVERYONE KEEP HIS OWN STAND ROUND SAID SHE
AND FROM THE WOOD WAS BORNE TOWARDS THEM THE SOUNDS OF THE UNKNOWN BELL WITH WONDERFUL DISTINCTNESS
AND NOW HAPPILY FOR HIM OFF FELL HIS FATAL SHOES--AND WITH THEM THE CHARM WAS AT AN END
SHE WANTED TO WARM HERSELF PEOPLE SAID
WHOM HAVE I THE HONOR OF SPEAKING ASKED THE LEARNED MAN
HE DID NOT TROUBLE HIMSELF IN THE LEAST ABOUT HIS SOLDIERS
AND THE MATCHES GAVE SUCH A BRILLIANT LIGHT THAT IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN AT NOON-DAY
HERE IS MY CARD--I LIVE ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET AND AM ALWAYS AT HOME IN RAINY WEATHER AND SO AWAY WENT THE SHADOW
THE MAN WAS DEAD
BETWEEN THE TREES A LONG BOARD IS HANGING--IT IS A SWING
THE OLD WHITE SNAILS WERE THE FIRST PERSONS OF DISTINCTION IN THE WORLD THAT THEY KNEW
BUT YOU GAVE HIM A GOOD BOX ON HIS EAR THAT MADE IT TINGLE BUT I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS YOU
CLEANLINESS IS A FINE THING
SHE DANCED AND WAS FORCED TO DANCE STRAIGHT OUT INTO THE GLOOMY WOOD
AND AS OF ANY OTHER KING OR EMPEROR ONE IS ACCUSTOMED TO SAY HE IS SITTING IN COUNCIL IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF HIM THE EMPEROR IS SITTING IN HIS WARDROBE TIME PASSED MERRILY IN THE LARGE TOWN WHICH WAS HIS CAPITAL
ONE EVENING A FEARFUL TEMPEST AROSE IT THUNDERED AND LIGHTENED AND THE RAIN POURED DOWN FROM THE SKY IN TORRENTS
SHE THEN SAT DOWN AND WEPT
AND WENT PROUDLY OVER THE COLLAR
AND SHE WOULD HAVE HER WILL FOR SHE WAS VERY SPOILED AND VERY HEADSTRONG
THE OLD MAN SAT AND ROCKED THE CRADLE AND THE MOTHER SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR CLOSE BY HIM AND LOOKED AT HER LITTLE SICK CHILD THAT DREW ITS BREATH SO DEEP AND RAISED ITS LITTLE HAND
AND OUT OF THE WHITE LILY LEAVES THE PRINCESS PEEPED TOO AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
BUT THOSE BELOW DID NOT HEAR HER FOR THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES
I WISH I HAD LEARNT IT NO MATTER SAID THE RAVEN
AND I HEAR THAT MY AXE RINGS DON'T STRIKE MY HEAD OFF SAID KAREN
AND UP THE SLOPE INTO THE OLD CHURCH WENT ALL THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF DENMARK HAND IN HAND ALL WITH THEIR GOLDEN CROWNS
I OUGHT NOW TO TELL YOU A STORY
HE HAS A HOME A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WEEP WITH HIM OVER HIS SORROWS WHO REJOICE WITH HIM WHEN HE IS GLAD
BUT WHEN HE WAS METAMORPHOSED INTO ONE THE FORMER PECULIARITIES CEASED IMMEDIATELY
CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LARDER STORIES NO SAID THE TREE
IT IS JUST AS ONE TAKES IT SAID THE SHADOW
HE HAS COME HERE IN ORDER TO GET HIS BEARD TO GROW THEY SAY BUT I SEE THE REAL CAUSE HE CANNOT CAST A SHADOW SHE HAD BECOME INQUISITIVE
BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
I WILL PAY THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES AND YOU WRITE THE DESCRIPTIONS--AND IF THEY ARE A LITTLE AMUSING FOR ME ON THE WAY
BESIDES IT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
ONLY LOOK WHAT IS STILL ON THE UGLY OLD CHRISTMAS TREE SAID HE TRAMPLING ON THE BRANCHES SO THAT THEY ALL CRACKED BENEATH HIS FEET
SHE KISSED HER OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP PUT ON HER RED SHOES AND WENT ALONE TO THE RIVER
THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD-LOOKING
AND YET I DRANK ONLY ONE GLASS OF PUNCH
BUT THE STORK LOOKED MUSING NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID YES
BUT IT WAS ONLY TO SEE IF THERE WAS A FIG OR AN APPLE LEFT THAT HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN
AND IN HIS HAND HE HELD A SWORD BROAD AND GLITTERING
I HAVE NOT BROUGHT MY GLOVES CRIED LITTLE GERDA
ALL ALL WAS OVER--EVERY TALE MUST END AT LAST
COO WHAT IS THAT YOU SAY UP THERE CRIED LITTLE GERDA
AND SO THEY GAVE THEM AS A DOWRY AND INHERITANCE THE WHOLE FOREST OF BURDOCKS AND SAID--WHAT THEY HAD ALWAYS SAID--THAT IT WAS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE POLISHED ON ACCOUNT OF THE VISIT
ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS HEARD A VIOLENT KNOCKING AT THE DOOR AND THE OLD KING THE PRINCE'S FATHER WENT OUT HIMSELF TO OPEN IT
HE COULD SEE SOLDIERS WITH HALBERDS AND SPOUTS WHERE THE WATER RAN LIKE DRAGONS AND SERPENTS
FOR HE KNEW THAT THE HONEY-BEES ALWAYS HAVE ONE
THE COACHMAN THE FOOTMEN AND THE OUTRIDERS FOR OUTRIDERS WERE THERE TOO ALL WORE GOLDEN CROWNS
AND OUT IN THE WOODS IT WAS SO PLEASANT WHEN THE SNOW WAS ON THE GROUND AND THE HARE LEAPED BY
IN HIS EYES THE FIGURES WERE EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL AND OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
IT WAS THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN WHO TIRED OF BEING AT HOME HAD DETERMINED TO MAKE A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FIXED FIRMLY IN THE GROUND IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TUMBLED DOWN
AND IT APPEARED AS IF THOSE TIMES HAD REALLY BEEN HAPPY TIMES
NOW THE PRINCESS HAPPENED TO WALK THAT WAY
IT IS SAID IN A VERY STRAIGHT-FORWARD AND WELL-MEANT MANNER
YES HE IS FOREVER FOLLOWING PEOPLE
AND WHEN THERE WAS A BREEZE I COULD BEND WITH AS MUCH STATELINESS AS THE OTHERS NEITHER THE SUNBEAMS NOR THE BIRDS NOR THE RED CLOUDS WHICH MORNING AND EVENING SAILED ABOVE HIM GAVE THE LITTLE TREE ANY PLEASURE
BUT AS THEY ENTERED THEY REMARKED THAT THEY WERE NOW GROWN UP
AND REMEMBRANCE NODDED AND THE OLD PEOPLE DECKED WITH CROWNS OF GOLD SAT IN THE FLUSH OF THE EVENING SUN
DO YOU NO LONGER REMEMBER THE SWEET FRUITS AND THE COOLING JUICE IN THE WILD PLANTS OF OUR NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN HOME SAID THE FORMER INHABITANT OF THE CANARY ISLES CONTINUING HIS DITHYRAMBIC
THE WOOD-PIGEONS COOED ABOVE IN THEIR CAGE AND THE OTHERS SLEPT
CHIRP CHIRP SIGHED HE
BUT I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE TO ENJOY MYSELF WHEN I AM BROUGHT OUT AGAIN BUT WHEN WAS THAT TO BE
WELL THERE HE LAY AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND ALL AT ONCE IT WAS JUST AS IF SOMEONE KISSED HIS EYES AND MOUTH
ON WITH THEM
I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON
THEY WERE ALMOST FIFTY YEARS OLD
THEN I CAN'T REPENT OF MY SINS
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING BETROTHED YES OF COURSE
WE GIVE OUR SERVANTS FINER CLOTH FOR THEIR LIVERY THAN WE OURSELVES USE AND SO I HAD MY SHADOW TRIMMED UP INTO A MAN
A MOTLEY PHANTASMAGORIA PRESENTS ITSELF BEFORE HIM WHICH HE DESCRIBES IN A FEW SATIRICAL TOUCHES YET WITHOUT EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OPENLY
IN GENERAL IT MEANS THE REDDISH-BROWN WOOD ITSELF
BUT AT THE WINDOW OPPOSITE THE OLD HOUSE THERE SAT A LITTLE BOY WITH FRESH ROSY CHEEKS AND BRIGHT BEAMING EYES
THE WATCHMAN'S SPIRIT UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON PRETTY WELL
I CANNOT BEAR IT BUT YOU MUST SAID THE LITTLE BOY
I ALWAYS SLEEP WITH THE KNIFE SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN
NO THE LITTLE DAMSEL WOUND HER ARMS ROUND THE BOY AND THEN THEY FLEW FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL DENMARK
THE CHRISTMAS-TREE WAS LIGHTED IN THE ROOM
SUDDENLY THEY FLEW ON ONE SIDE
THEY TEASE HIM
I CANNOT FIND WHAT I SEEK
HE WAS DRAGGING ALONG SOME POINTED FLAT PIECES OF ICE WHICH HE LAID TOGETHER IN ALL POSSIBLE WAYS FOR HE WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING WITH THEM
SO THEY DANCED ONCE MORE TOGETHER
THIS PATTERN AND THE COLORS YES I WILL TELL THE EMPEROR WITHOUT DELAY HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL I THINK THEM WE SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID THE IMPOSTORS AND THEN THEY NAMED THE DIFFERENT COLORS AND DESCRIBED THE PATTERN OF THE PRETENDED STUFF
A LONG TIME PASSED AND PEOPLE SAID TO EACH OTHER--"I WONDER IF THERE IS A CHURCH OUT IN THE WOOD
TACK AND THE FINGER MOVED ROUND
I OFFER YOU MY HAND RAG SAID THE BOX-IRON
ONE WORE A CAP OF TWO STARING COLORS DENOTING THE CLASS OF PERSONS TO WHICH SHE BELONGED
ONE MUST ENCOURAGE ART SAID SHE I AM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
IF YOU WILL TAKE THE LAMP I WILL GO BEFORE
HE NEVER THOUGHT OF GERDA AND LEAST OF ALL THAT SHE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE PALACE
I CANNOT RECOGNISE EAST STREET AGAIN
THE RED SHOES THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS VERY PRETTY AND DELICATE BUT IN SUMMER SHE WAS FORCED TO RUN ABOUT WITH BARE FEET SHE WAS SO POOR AND IN WINTER WEAR VERY LARGE WOODEN SHOES WHICH MADE HER LITTLE INSTEPS QUITE RED AND THAT LOOKED SO DANGEROUS
RATHER SPEAK OF SOMETHING AT WHICH ONE MAY LAUGH HEARTILY
HE SQUEEZED THE WATER OUT OF HIS DRIPPING HAIR WARMED HIS HANDS BETWEEN HIS OWN AND BOILED FOR HIM SOME SWEET WINE
SO THEN THE FIR TREE TOLD THE WHOLE FAIRY TALE FOR HE COULD REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE WORD OF IT
I WILL MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF MY RED SHOES IF YOU WILL GIVE HIM BACK TO ME AND AS IT SEEMED TO HER THE BLUE WAVES NODDED IN A STRANGE MANNER
WHAT WILL YOU TAKE FOR THE KITCHEN-POT SAID THE LADY
AND PEOPLE SAID SHE WAS A NICE LITTLE THING BUT THE LOOKING-GLASS SAID
BUT I WILL GO FIRST SAID THE SHADOW
AND HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF THEY ARE UP STILL HE LOOKED FOR THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD VANISHED
YOU TREMBLE SAID THE PRINCESS AS THE SHADOW CAME INTO HER CHAMBER
YOU GO AWAY WHEN THE MATCH BURNS OUT
AND WHAT DID IT SAY
THAT ANIMAL NECESSITY IN SHORT TO SNATCH AT LEAST AT A FALLEN LEAF OF THE BREAD-FRUIT TREE IF NOT AT THE FRUIT ITSELF
HE MADE HIMSELF GREAT
AT ALL EVENTS IT MUST BE THOSE WHICH ARE WET THOUGHT HE
ALL THIS LOOKED CHARMING BUT THE OLD LADY COULD NOT SEE WELL AND SO HAD NO PLEASURE IN THEM
AND THEN WE WERE CONFIRMED
AND THERE STOOD EASY-CHAIRS WITH SUCH HIGH BACKS AND SO CARVED OUT AND WITH ARMS ON BOTH SIDES
HERE THE DREAMS WERE RUSHING PAST BUT THEY HASTENED BY SO QUICKLY THAT GERDA COULD NOT SEE THE HIGH PERSONAGES
ALAS SAID THE LEARNED MAN
EACH SIGH WAS LIKE A SHOT
AND THEN THE KNAVES ASKED FOR MORE SILK AND GOLD SAYING THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE WHAT THEY HAD BEGUN
BUT I DID NOT DO IT ALTHOUGH I COULD HAVE DONE SO
FOR AS TO A DOOR SHE HAD NONE
IT IS ONLY A FANCY THAT PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN INTO THEIR HEADS AT THE SAME MOMENT THE BELL SOUNDED DEEP IN THE WOOD SO CLEAR AND SOLEMNLY THAT FIVE OR SIX DETERMINED TO PENETRATE SOMEWHAT FURTHER
THE ROBBERS SAT ROUND THE FIRE SANG AND DRANK
THERE LIVED TWO LITTLE CHILDREN WHO HAD A GARDEN SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN A FLOWER-POT
SEE WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES SAID THE SOLDIER
AND CURED OF ALL HIS PAROXYSMS OF LOVE HE HASTENED OFF TO HIS ROOM WHERE THE PAINS CONSEQUENT ON THE FRIGHT THE SHOES HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DID NOT SO SOON TAKE THEIR LEAVE
THERE THOU HAST THINE EYES SAID DEATH
GERDA KISSED HIS CHEEKS AND THEY GREW QUITE BLOOMING
I HAVE IN ALL RESPECTS BECOME VERY WELL OFF
IT IS THE LIGHT WHICH ADORNS ME SAID THE FLOWER
AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT BOASTED SO TERRIBLY AFTERWARDS OF WHAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO IT
THE ATMOSPHERE GLOWED LIKE FIRE
BUT I'M CONDEMNED TO SILENCE
AND WHY YOU HAVE STARTED OFF IN THE WIDE WORLD ALONE AND GERDA RELATED ALL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
BESIDES THEY ARE AFRAID OF MY BEAK
ALL HIS RETINUE NOW STRAINED THEIR EYES HOPING TO DISCOVER SOMETHING ON THE LOOMS BUT THEY COULD SEE NO MORE THAN THE OTHERS
OH HOW GERDA'S HEART BEAT WITH ANXIETY AND LONGING
SHALL I PURCHASE MY FREEDOM FROM SERVICE
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO ENTER THE PALACE FOR YOU ARE BAREFOOTED
THE FIRE BURNED WITH SUCH BLESSED INFLUENCE
BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS IN SUCH A TREMENDOUS HURRY AND THE LITTLE ONE IS BEGINNING TO BE THE SAME
I CANNOT BEAR IT SAID THE PEWTER SOLDIER
THESE ARE MY OLD NORTHERN-LIGHTS SAID THE REINDEER LOOK HOW THEY GLEAM AND ON HE NOW SPED STILL QUICKER--DAY AND NIGHT ON HE WENT
AND SHE NOW RELATED MANY PRETTY THINGS OUT OF HOLBERG'S COMEDIES AND ABOUT WALDEMAR AND ABSALON
I'VE FELT SO QUEER ALL OF A SUDDEN
HOLBERG DENMARK'S MOLIERE FOUNDED HERE AN ACADEMY FOR THE SONS OF THE NOBLES
THAT IT IS NOT PRIDE
THESE BATHS ARE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD
YOU ARE A VERY FREE AND HAPPY BEING
THAT SWINEHERD MUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WELL EDUCATED
DON'T TOUCH THE FLOWER SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THERE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD RUN ABOUT JUST AS WHEN AT HOME BUT HE SOON FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE
SHE PUT ON THE RED SHOES SHE MIGHT DO THAT ALSO SHE THOUGHT
BUT HAVE YOU NOT THOUGHT OF IT
SIXTH STORY
HEROSTRATUS OR ERATOSTRATUS--AN EPHESIAN WHO WANTONLY SET FIRE TO THE FAMOUS TEMPLE OF DIANA IN ORDER TO COMMEMORATE HIS NAME BY SO UNCOMMON AN ACTION
SHE WISHED TO SEAT HERSELF ON A POOR MAN'S GRAVE WHERE THE BITTER TANSY GREW
HE WAS QUITE ILL AT LAST
WHAT IS TO HAPPEN NOW AND THE LIGHTS BURNED DOWN TO THE VERY BRANCHES AND AS THEY BURNED DOWN THEY WERE PUT OUT ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND THEN THE CHILDREN HAD PERMISSION TO PLUNDER THE TREE
AND HOW GRACEFULLY THE SCARF HANGS IN SHORT NO ONE WOULD ALLOW THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THESE MUCH-ADMIRED CLOTHES
BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT
BUT IN WINTER THEY WERE OBLIGED FIRST TO GO DOWN THE LONG STAIRS AND THEN UP THE LONG STAIRS AGAIN
NOW THEY LIVED A VERY LONELY AND HAPPY LIFE
SHE CARRIED A QUANTITY OF MATCHES IN AN OLD APRON AND SHE HELD A BUNDLE OF THEM IN HER HAND
SIT DOWN SAID THEY
DANCE SHALT THOU FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND WHERE PROUD VAIN CHILDREN DWELL THOU SHALT KNOCK THAT THEY MAY HEAR THEE AND TREMBLE
1482-1513 WHILE THE CONVERSATION TURNED ON THIS SUBJECT AND WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A JOURNAL THAT CONTAINED NOTHING WORTH READING WE WILL JUST STEP OUT INTO THE ANTECHAMBER WHERE CLOAKS MACKINTOSHES STICKS UMBRELLAS AND SHOES WERE DEPOSITED
ONE NEEDED ONLY TO STEP OVER THE GUTTER TO GET FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER
OTHER PIECES WERE PUT IN SPECTACLES
SHE RUBBED ANOTHER AGAINST THE WALL
ONE WROTE A WHOLE POEM ABOUT IT AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL
BUT THERE WAS A GREAT BALL IN THE CITY TO WHICH KAREN WAS INVITED
THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN--RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE--DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
THERE WERE WHOLE LONG PROCESSIONS AND PAGEANTS WITH THE STRANGEST CHARACTERS WHICH ONE NEVER SEES NOW-A-DAYS
WILL YOU GIVE THE LITTLE MAIDEN A POTION THAT SHE MAY POSSESS THE STRENGTH OF TWELVE MEN AND VANQUISH THE SNOW QUEEN THE STRENGTH OF TWELVE MEN SAID THE FINLAND WOMAN
DO GO ON THEY WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT IVEDY-AVEDY TOO BUT THE LITTLE MAN ONLY TOLD THEM ABOUT HUMPY-DUMPY
HE IS MERCIFUL AND YOU WILL ALSO BE SO
THAT IS MY STORY SAID THE LILY
I AM EXTREMELY FOND OF THAT STRANGER
I WILL TELL ALL CHILDREN ABOUT HIM THAT THEY MAY TAKE CARE AND NOT PLAY WITH HIM FOR HE WILL ONLY CAUSE THEM SORROW AND MANY A HEARTACHE AND ALL GOOD CHILDREN TO WHOM HE RELATED THIS STORY TOOK GREAT HEED OF THIS NAUGHTY CUPID
WE ARE OBLIGED TO LOCK THIS FELLOW IN TOO OR HE WOULD MAKE HIS ESCAPE
DOLLS THAT LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE MEN--THE TREE HAD NEVER BEHELD SUCH BEFORE--WERE SEEN AMONG THE FOLIAGE AND AT THE VERY TOP A LARGE STAR OF GOLD TINSEL WAS FIXED
THE RAIN-WATER SHOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF THE MOUTH BUT IT RAN OUT OF THE BELLY FOR THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE SPOUT
ALL THAT I HAVE IS A FINE GENTLEMAN A BOOT-JACK AND A HAIR-COMB
WHAT DID THE CONVOLVULUS SAY
AND WHEN THEY LAID THEM ON THE HEADS OF THE OLD PEOPLE EACH FLOWER BECAME A GOLDEN CROWN
IN SUMMER WITH ONE JUMP THEY COULD GET TO EACH OTHER
AH
AH
AH
AH
IT WAS BESIDES RATHER FOGGY SO THAT IN THE DARKNESS ALL OBJECTS SEEMED MINGLED IN CHAOTIC CONFUSION
A MATCH MIGHT AFFORD HER A WORLD OF COMFORT IF SHE ONLY DARED TAKE A SINGLE ONE OUT OF THE BUNDLE DRAW IT AGAINST THE WALL AND WARM HER FINGERS BY IT
THE ANGELS PATTED HER HANDS AND FEET
UNHAPPY CREATURE THAT I AM SAID THE PRINCESS
AMONG THE AUDIENCE WAS THE YOUNG MAN OF THE HOSPITAL WHO SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HIS ADVENTURE OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT
HOW COULDST THOU COME QUICKER THAN I I AM A MOTHER SAID SHE
AND SO HE GOT PERMISSION OF HIS PARENTS AND THEN WENT OVER TO THE OLD HOUSE
HAS HE NOT BEEN CREEPING UP THAT STALK THESE THREE DAYS
THE WALLS OF THE PALACE WERE OF DRIVING SNOW AND THE WINDOWS AND DOORS OF CUTTING WINDS
HOW CLOSE IT WAS IN THE CHAMBER
AT THE SAME TIME MAKING THE SAME GESTURES AS BEFORE AND TALKING OF THE DESIGN AND COLORS WHICH WERE NOT THERE
I AM QUITE CHANGED
IN HIS EYES SHE WAS PERFECT HE DID NOT FEAR HER AT ALL AND TOLD HER THAT HE COULD CALCULATE IN HIS HEAD AND WITH FRACTIONS EVEN
AND FATHER AND MOTHER WERE JUST AS PIOUS
HE IS BLOWING SOAP-BUBBLES
A CRUMPLED LETTER AND THE SEAL BROKEN YES
IN HIS RIGHT POCKET HE HAD HIS LETTER OF CREDIT IN THE LEFT HIS PASSPORT AND IN A SMALL LEATHERN PURSE SOME DOUBLE LOUIS D'OR CAREFULLY SEWN UP IN THE BOSOM OF HIS WAISTCOAT
AS SOON AS YOU FOUND I WAS CAPABLE TO GO OUT ALONE IN THE WORLD I WENT MY OWN WAY
FAREWELL INSTINCTIVELY THE CLERK OBEYED
THE CLOTHES BECAME FEATHERS AND THE GALOSHES CLAWS
THE PORTRAIT OF HER WHO HAD BEEN FOUND AT THE BROKER'S CAME TO THE BROKER'S AGAIN
THIS IS JUST THE TIME WHEN YOU OUGHT TO LOOK PLEASED
AND IT WAS A HAPPINESS TO SEE HOW THE ONE BECAME A BLESSING TO THE WORLD TO SEE HOW MUCH HAPPINESS AND JOY WERE FELT EVERYWHERE
SHE LOOKED AT THE OLD LADY WHO COULD NOT RECOVER SHE LOOKED AT THE RED SHOES AND SHE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE NO SIN IN IT
SHE TOLD HIM FROM WHAT LAND SHE CAME AND HE KNEW THAT LAND
AND BENEATH THEM THE CHILLING STORM RUSHED FAST THE WOLVES HOWLED THE SNOW CRACKLED
I MUST NOT REST ANY LONGER AND SHE GOT UP TO GO FURTHER
AND THEN IT WAS AUTUMN AND THEN WINTER
IN THE DITCHES RED AND YELLOW FLOWERS WERE GROWING
YES I HAVE LIVED TO SEE MUCH OF THAT SORT OF THING
THEN SHE SAID SHE WOULD AGAIN GO FORTH IN THE WIDE WORLD AND LOOK FOR KAY
IF YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY WILL BE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES WE WILL FIT ON THE NEW SUIT IN FRONT OF THE LOOKING GLASS THE EMPEROR WAS ACCORDINGLY UNDRESSED AND THE ROGUES PRETENDED TO ARRAY HIM IN HIS NEW SUIT
YOU SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING FREE ON THE JOURNEY NAY THAT IS TOO BAD SAID THE LEARNED MAN
THE LITTLE BLACK DOG AS LIGHT AS A SOAP-BUBBLE JUMPS UP ON HIS HIND LEGS TO TRY TO GET INTO THE SWING
THESE MUST BE GOT OUT FIRST
BUT BEFORE I TELL IT THOU MUST FIRST SING FOR ME ALL THE SONGS THOU HAST SUNG FOR THY CHILD
AND SHE KISSED THE HAND WHICH HAD WIELDED THE AXE AND WENT OVER THE HEATH
HE WILL GET NOTHING BUT A GRAVE
SHOOT STOOD BY SHOOT AND IT SAID QUITE DISTINCTLY THE AIR HAS CHERISHED ME THE SUN HAS KISSED ME AND PROMISED ME A LITTLE FLOWER ON SUNDAY
HOW SPLENDID THAT WAS SAID THE LITTLE BOY
HE MEANT IT FOR CHARLES AND IT IS ALL WELL ENOUGH IF ONE DOES BUT KNOW IT
I AM VERY SURE I SHOULD MAKE NO SUCH MISERABLE VERSES AS THE OTHERS
JUST AS IF I WERE AT RINGSTEAD
WHEREON THE OTHERS SAID SUCH PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO BE WISER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE THEY NOW LET HIM GO ON ALONE
BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT THE DOOR WHICH WAS ONLY AJAR AND WHICH LED TO THE NEXT ROOM BEGAN TO CREAK AND SUPPLE AND CREEPING CAME THE LARGE TOMCAT INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO PURSUE HIM
THE YOUNG COUPLE GOVERNED IN THE FOREST AND HAD A NUMEROUS PROGENY BUT THEY WERE NEVER BOILED AND NEVER CAME ON THE SILVER DISHES
IN AN IMMENSE CALDRON SOUP WAS BOILING
THE OTHER RAVEN STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AND FLAPPED HER WINGS
ONE MIGHT FANCY ONE HAS NOTHING AT ALL ON WHEN DRESSED IN IT
ONE OF THE TRAVELLERS KEPT WATCH WHILE THE OTHERS SLEPT
PROJECTING OVER A NARROW MOUNTAIN-PATH THERE HANGS AN OLD FEUDAL CASTLE
WHAT A DESIGN
MY PERCEPTION OF THINGS IS CLEAR I FEEL AS LIGHT AND CHEERFUL AS THOUGH I WERE IN HEAVEN
AND SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE TOWN
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO DIE--BUT A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS QUITE CONGENIAL TO HIM AND HE DID NOT REMARK THE COLD THAT WAS AROUND HIM
I HAVE SURELY A DISPOSITION TO MADNESS--'TIS DREADFULLY HOT HERE
AND WHILE SHE COMBED LITTLE GERDA'S HAIR THE CHILD FORGOT HER FOSTER-BROTHER KAY MORE AND MORE FOR THE OLD WOMAN UNDERSTOOD MAGIC
AND GERDA TOLD HER ALL
THAT HE HAD BEEN DROWNED IN THE RIVER WHICH FLOWED CLOSE TO THE TOWN
AND SHE LAID HOLD OF THE HORNS OF A REINDEER THAT HAD A BRIGHT COPPER RING ROUND ITS NECK AND WAS TETHERED TO THE SPOT
AT LAST SHE COULD RUN NO LONGER
BUT THE POOR MOTHER COULD NOT SEE IT
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THE WEAVERS ARE GETTING ON WITH MY CLOTH SAID THE EMPEROR TO HIMSELF AFTER SOME LITTLE TIME HAD ELAPSED
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY I WILL THANK YOU NOT TO SPEAK TO ME SAID THE GARTER
BUT YOU YOURSELF DO NOT BELONG TO THE COMMON ORDER
THEIR CLOTHES WOULD GET SO TORN
AND THEN IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WASHING-TUB
EVEN SUCH A LITTLE GARDEN AS THIS WAS CONSIDERED IN THE METROPOLIS OF COPENHAGEN AS A GREAT LUXURY
AND WHEN GERDA HAD FINISHED THE LORD'S PRAYER SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A WHOLE LEGION
YES YES SHE OFTEN DWELLS A RECLUSE IN LARGE CITIES
BUT TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE LITTLE GIRL AND GERDA STRETCHED OUT HER HANDS WITH THE LARGE WADDED GLOVES TOWARDS THE ROBBER MAIDEN AND SAID FAREWELL AND THE REINDEER FLEW ON OVER BUSH AND BRAMBLE THROUGH THE GREAT WOOD OVER MOOR AND HEATH AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
AND INVOLUNTARILY HE PICKED ONE OF THE NEAREST FLOWERS
THEY TAP AT MY FOREHEAD AND SAY HERE WE ARE WON'T THERE BE A TAP SOON ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
SOME WRETCHED HOVELS FOR THE DUTCH SAILORS RESEMBLING GREAT BOXES AND AFTER WHICH THE PLACE WAS NAMED LAY ABOUT IN CONFUSED DISORDER ON THE OPPOSITE BANK
AND THE KING'S SON SPREAD OUT HIS ARMS TOWARDS HEAVEN AND WOOD AND SEA
I FEEL MYSELF AS IF PRESSED TO THE EARTH IN MY FIRST SITUATION WITH YOU
AND THEY WERE ACCORDINGLY PUT INTO LARGE SILVER CASKETS AND SENT TO HER
I HAVE IT
IT IS WET IT IS WET
THE AIR IS SO UNUSUALLY CLEAR THE CLOUDS SAIL ON SO BUOYANTLY AND FROM THE GREEN HERBAGE A FRAGRANCE IS EXHALED THAT FILLS ME WITH DELIGHT
NAY HOW LONELY THE OLD MAN IS--DO YOU THINK THAT HE GETS KISSES
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE A HUSBAND WHO KNEW HOW TO GIVE AN ANSWER WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO--NOT ONE WHO LOOKED ONLY AS IF HE WERE A GREAT PERSONAGE FOR THAT IS SO TIRESOME
SHE MUST BE NURSED AND WAITED UPON AND THERE WAS NO ONE WHOSE DUTY IT WAS SO MUCH AS KAREN'S
IT CONSISTED OF A SOUP OF SALTED WATER SEASONED WITH PEPPER AND RANCID OIL
AND LITTLE TUKEY LAY IN HIS BED
BUT YOU MUST SHOW ME THE OLD MAN'S GRAVE BUT I DO NOT KNOW IT SAID HE AND NO ONE KNOWS IT
THEIR PARENTS LIVED EXACTLY OPPOSITE
AND AMONGST MILLIONS SHE KNEW HER CHILD'S
AND THAT THE SHADOW COULD REMARK FOR SHE ALMOST PIERCED HIM THROUGH WITH HER EYES
IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE HOUSE SLEPT OR THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME
HOW DELIGHTFUL TO BE OUT IN THE AIR NEAR THE FRESH ROSE-BUSHES THAT SEEM AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER FINISH BLOSSOMING
BUT THE POOR CHILD THAT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WAS QUITE ASHAMED
WE KNOW WHO HAS SOUP AND WHO HAS PANCAKES FOR DINNER TO-DAY WHO HAS CUTLETS AND WHO HAS EGGS
THERE IN THE MARKET-PLACE SOME OF THE BOLDEST OF THE BOYS USED TO TIE THEIR SLEDGES TO THE CARTS AS THEY PASSED BY AND SO THEY WERE PULLED ALONG AND GOT A GOOD RIDE
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE LEARNED MAN
I MADE MYSELF LONG UP THE WALLS--IT TICKLES THE BACK SO DELIGHTFULLY
AND WHAT CAN YOU DO THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
ALL THE PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE CITY HAD HEARD OF THE WONDERFUL PROPERTY THE CLOTH WAS TO POSSESS
FOR SHE FANCIED SHE WAS A STEAM-ENGINE THAT WOULD GO ON THE RAILROAD AND DRAW THE WAGGONS
AND SOON AFTER CAME ANOTHER CONFECTIONER WHO HUNG A BELL OVER HIS STAND AS A SIGN OR ORNAMENT BUT IT HAD NO CLAPPER AND IT WAS TARRED OVER TO PRESERVE IT FROM THE RAIN
THE GREATEST SPLENDOR AND THE GREATEST MAGNIFICENCE ONE CAN IMAGINE AWAIT THEM
THEY ENTERED AND HASTENED UP TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S ROOM WHERE EVERYTHING WAS STANDING AS FORMERLY
WHY I DECLARE THE SHOES LOOK JUST LIKE MY OWN SAID ONE OF THE CLERKS EYING THE NEWLY-FOUND TREASURE WHOSE HIDDEN POWERS EVEN HE SHARP AS HE WAS WAS NOT ABLE TO DISCOVER
A MORE CLEVER OR A MORE LOVELY COUNTENANCE HE COULD NOT FANCY TO HIMSELF
HE WINKED HIS EYES
SHE IS QUITE LONELY AND OLD ENOUGH TO BE MARRIED
THOUSANDS OF LIGHTS WERE BURNING ON THE GREEN BRANCHES AND GAILY-COLORED PICTURES SUCH AS SHE HAD SEEN IN THE SHOP-WINDOWS LOOKED DOWN UPON HER
HE THOUGHT OF THE DISTRESS AND AGONY HE HAD ENDURED AND PRAISED FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF HIS HEART THE HAPPY REALITY--OUR OWN TIME--WHICH WITH ALL ITS DEFICIENCIES IS YET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IN WHICH SO MUCH AGAINST HIS INCLINATION HE HAD LATELY BEEN
TIS OVER--'TIS PAST SAID THE POOR TREE
WHEN WE ARE AT THE END OF THE STORY WE SHALL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW
BUT HE MADE FOOLS OF THEM STILL FOR HE IS ASTONISHINGLY CUNNING
HE THOUGHT OF HIS FIRST YOUTH IN THE WOOD OF THE MERRY CHRISTMAS-EVE AND OF THE LITTLE MICE WHO HAD LISTENED WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE TO THE STORY OF HUMPY-DUMPY
INDEED COUNCILLOR KNAP DEFENDED THIS OPINION SO WARMLY THAT THE HOSTESS DECLARED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS SIDE AND BOTH EXERTED THEMSELVES WITH UNWEARIED ELOQUENCE
IT SEEMED AS IF HE HAD BEEN ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN
A COFFIN DECKED WITH FLOWERS WAS BORNE FORTH
I KNOW I AM A CLEVER FELLOW
BUT THE COLLAR CAME TO BE JUST THIS VERY PIECE OF WHITE PAPER WE HERE SEE AND ON WHICH THE STORY IS PRINTED
WE OTHERS ARE CHAINED BY THE LEG AND HELD FAST TO OUR DESK YES
FOR TO-DAY HOWEVER SHE WOULD ALLOW IT
THEY COULD HARDLY HOLD IT FAST
THAT THEY WERE OF A FAMILY FROM FOREIGN LANDS AND THAT FOR THEM AND THEIRS THE WHOLE FOREST WAS PLANTED
IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE
THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE BOX THEY ARE PLANTED IN AND THEN HE GAVE THE BOX A GOOD KICK WITH HIS FOOT AND PULLED BOTH THE ROSES UP
THERE EVERY ACQUAINTANCE APPEARS AND SPEAKS UPON THE STAGE SO ENTIRELY IN CHARACTER AND WITH THE SAME TONE OF VOICE THAT NONE OF US WHEN AWAKE WERE ABLE TO IMITATE IT
THE DIFFERENCE ONLY IS THAT THE POET POSSESSES A BETTER MENTAL MEMORY ON WHICH ACCOUNT HE IS ABLE TO RETAIN THE FEELING AND THE THOUGHT TILL THEY CAN BE EMBODIED BY MEANS OF WORDS
AND HE HAD A COAT WITH LARGE BRASS BUTTONS AND A WIG THAT ONE COULD SEE WAS A REAL WIG
BUT EVERYBODY WAS JUST AS WISE AS BEFORE
THIS MUST BE LOOKED TO SO HE REMAINED AND LET THE OTHERS GO ON WITHOUT HIM
AND THEN FROM A HIGHER POSITION WHENCE HE COULD OVERLOOK THE CROWD PASS THE COMPANY IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES
MY MOTHER SAYS THAT ALL YOU LOOK AT CAN BE TURNED INTO A FAIRY TALE
MANY A NIGHT HAVE I GOT UP TO SEE IF THE WIND HAD NOT CHANGED
THEY OFFERED TO LET HER STAY AT THE PALACE AND LEAD A HAPPY LIFE
HAVE YOU NOT MET THEM ANYWHERE THE SWALLOWS DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
YOU DESERVE TO BE A BARONESS SAID THE COLLAR
TIS A BITTER CRUST ALAS
AND HE SIGHED AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
AND WHY DO THEY RETAIN ALL THEIR BRANCHES
MANY YEARS PASSED AWAY
POOR LITTLE CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN
EXCELLENZA MISERABILI SIGHED THEY THRUSTING FORTH THEIR DEFORMED LIMBS TO VIEW
JUST AS THEY WERE IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THEIR AMUSEMENT A LARGE SLEDGE PASSED BY
THE BOYS PLAYED ABOUT IN THE COURT AND THE YOUNGEST WORE THE GOLD STAR ON HIS BREAST WHICH THE TREE HAD HAD ON THE HAPPIEST EVENING OF HIS LIFE
THERE THE PEOPLE BECOME QUITE A MAHOGANY BROWN AY AND IN THE HOTTEST LANDS THEY ARE BURNT TO NEGROES
HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
ALL THAT THE HEART CARED AND LONGED FOR WAS GOOD NIGHT-QUARTERS
ONLY THINK HE SHOT AN ARROW ONCE AT YOUR OLD GRANDMOTHER
HOW DIRTY IT IS HERE SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR
THE ONE STORY STOOD FORWARD A GREAT WAY OVER THE OTHER
IT IS TRUE I WAS ALWAYS A FINE STARCHED-UP GENTLEMAN
AND HE FELL ON HIS KNEES SUNG HIS EVENING HYMN AND SAID
YOU SHALL SLEEP WITH ME TO-NIGHT WITH ALL MY ANIMALS SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN
I WILL TELL EVERYTHING
AND YONDER WHERE SEA AND SKY MEET STOOD THE SUN LIKE A LARGE SHINING ALTAR ALL MELTED TOGETHER IN THE MOST GLOWING COLORS
BESIDES YOU GOOD-FOR-NOTHING RASCAL IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO CATCH BIRDS IN THE ROYAL GARDENS OF FREDERICKSBURG
SHE NOW LED GERDA INTO THE FLOWER-GARDEN
I AM VERY HAPPY TO THINK THAT WE HAVE OUR GOOD HOUSE AND THE LITTLE ONE HAS HIS ALSO
THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS GERDA WAS OBLIGED TO REST HERSELF AGAIN WHEN EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO HER A LARGE RAVEN CAME HOPPING OVER THE WHITE SNOW
WHILE HIS EYES WERE FIXED WITH GLASSY STARE ON THE MOON LOOKING FOR THE GOOD OLD FELLOW OF A SPIRIT WHICH STILL HAUNTED IT
FOR THEY KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT IT WAS THE DAY OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY AND HAD COME WITH THEIR GRATULATIONS THAT VERY MORNING
TO SEE THE KJOGE HENS IS AN EXPRESSION SIMILAR TO SHOWING A CHILD LONDON WHICH IS SAID TO BE DONE BY TAKING HIS HEAD IN BOTH BANDS AND SO LIFTING HIM OFF THE GROUND
IT CANNOT BE LESS WITH YOU EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN--AND THENCE THE PROVERB IT IS SO MAHOGANY!"--(THAT IS SO EXCESSIVELY FINE)--IS DERIVED
I CANNOT DISCOVER THE LEAST BIT OF THREAD ON THE LOOMS HOWEVER HE DID NOT EXPRESS HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD
ASK THEM ONLY AND YOU WILL HEAR WHAT THEY'LL TELL YOU
THE CLERGYMAN HAD SPOKEN SO TOUCHINGLY THE CHILDREN WHO WERE CONFIRMED HAD BEEN GREATLY MOVED
LET US ASK OLD NANNY THAT WAS NO FAIRY TALE TIS TRUE SAID OLD NANNY
THE ROSES ON THE LEADS HUNG BLOOMING IN AT THE OPEN WINDOW
THE NARROW STREET WITH THE HIGH HOUSES WAS BUILT SO THAT THE SUNSHINE MUST FALL THERE FROM MORNING TILL EVENING--IT WAS REALLY NOT TO BE BORNE
AND THE DOOR WAS SO LOW THAT THE FAMILY WERE OBLIGED TO CREEP UPON THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT IN OR OUT
THE PARROT FLAPPED HIS WINGS AND CRIED COME LET US BE MEN THE CLERK FELT A MORTAL FRIGHT AND FLEW THROUGH THE WINDOW FAR AWAY OVER THE HOUSES AND STREETS
THE STRANGER'S LANDLORD SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE ONE SAW NO PERSON ABOUT AND AS TO THE MUSIC IT APPEARED TO HIM TO BE EXTREMELY TIRESOME
HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON-STRICKEN
THE LAST IS STILL HANGING TO THE END OF THE PIPE AND ROCKS IN THE BREEZE
AT WHICH I AM CONDEMNED TO GNAW NOBODY COULD BE MORE STEADY OR QUIET THAN THIS YOUNG MAN
OUT OF THE SPOUT EVEN DID THEY SPREAD THEMSELVES ON ALL SIDES AND GREW LARGER AND LARGER
THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL-RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL
FOR THEY THOUGHT OF THEIR OLD AGE AND SAID IT IS A GOOD THING TO HAVE A PROVISION FOR OUR OLD DAYS AND THE PRINCE GOT UP AND LET GERDA SLEEP IN HIS BED AND MORE THAN THIS HE COULD NOT DO
IT PENETRATED TO HIS VERY HEART WHICH WAS ALREADY ALMOST A FROZEN LUMP
THE WOMAN DIDN'T THINK HOW MUCH SHE CONCEALED
MY HUSBAND IS COME BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT
IT WAS ONE THAT SAID NOTHING ABOUT KAY EITHER
DO THE WHITE BEES CHOOSE A QUEEN ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
EVERY TREE AND EVERY FLOWER HAD ITS NAME
BUT IT WAS THE OLD SOLDIER WITH THE RED BEARD
BUT I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHICH WAY HE TOOK UNLESS THOU WILT FIRST WARM ME UP AT THY HEART
THE OTHER WAS A POOR BOY WHO HAD BORROWED HIS COAT AND BOOTS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FROM THE INNKEEPER'S SON AND HE WAS TO GIVE THEM BACK BY A CERTAIN HOUR
BUT I DO NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT DESPISE THE MODERN ONES
KAY HAS NEVER SEEN THEM AND THEN I'LL GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND ASK THERE IT WAS QUITE EARLY
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVEN THE BLOCKS OF ICE DANCED ABOUT FOR JOY
SO THEY ALL ASSERTED HE HAD NOT JUMPED AT ALL
HE SAID MOREOVER THAT HE BELONGED TO A VERY ANCIENT EGYPTIAN FAMILY AND THAT IN THE HOUSE WHERE HE THEN WAS HE WAS THOUGHT MUCH OF
THE POOR POET LAY ON THE EARTH AND WEPT FOR THE ARROW HAD REALLY FLOWN INTO HIS HEART
IS HE NOT YET COME IS IT KAY THAT YOU MEAN ASKED LITTLE GERDA
AND HE WISHED TO MARRY
A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL IN A LARGE TOWN WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY HOUSES AND SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THERE IS NO ROOF LEFT FOR EVERYBODY TO HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN
AND THEN WE HAD OUR FIRST LITTLE BOY AND THEN MARY AND NICHOLAS AND PETER AND CHRISTIAN YES AND HOW THEY ALL GREW UP TO BE HONEST PEOPLE AND WERE BELOVED BY EVERYBODY AND THEIR CHILDREN ALSO HAVE CHILDREN SAID THE OLD SAILOR
THE COLLAR WAS A LITTLE JAGGED AT THE EDGE AND SO CAME THE LONG SCISSORS TO CUT OFF THE JAGGED PART
FORGET MY TEARS FORGET MY PRAYERS AND ALL THAT I HAVE DONE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEE SAID DEATH
THEIR FACES WERE SO DISTORTED THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE RECOGNISED
AND THEN SHE KISSED HIS FOREHEAD
THERE LIES MY BOW
BESIDE THEM ON LATHS AND PERCHES SAT NEARLY A HUNDRED PIGEONS ALL ASLEEP SEEMINGLY
THEY WERE THE OUTPOSTS OF THE SNOW QUEEN
WONDERFUL VERY WONDERFUL!--AND THIS--WHAT HAVE I HERE
THIS IS TOO BAD
LITTLE TUKEY CRIED SOMEONE NEAR
BUT IT IS WONDERFUL HOW ONE CAN DREAM SO NATURALLY AND KNOW BESIDES SO EXACTLY THAT IT IS BUT A DREAM
CLOSE BY STOOD A BOY WHO DASHED HIS STICK INTO A WET DITCH
AND AT SUCH TIMES ALL THE PEOPLE SAID THE BOY IS CERTAINLY VERY CLEVER BUT IT WAS THE GLASS HE HAD GOT IN HIS EYE
HE MADE HIMSELF LITTLE
SHE SENDS YOU HER COMPLIMENTS
TELL ME IF YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND MY PLAYFELLOW AND THE RANUNCULUS SHONE BRIGHTLY AND LOOKED AGAIN AT GERDA
AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR
HER NEPHEW A MERRY BOY WHO WAS HIS AUNT'S DARLING BEGGED SO LONG FOR THESE SPECTACLES THAT AT LAST SHE LENT HIM THE TREASURE AFTER HAVING INFORMED HIM WITH MANY EXHORTATIONS THAT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE INTERESTING TRICK HE NEED ONLY REPAIR TO SOME PLACE WHERE A GREAT MANY PERSONS WERE ASSEMBLED
THE NEWLY-BAKED CAKES WERE ATTACKED
BUT AT HIS DEPARTURE THE LITTLE MAIDEN TOOK AN ELDER-BLOSSOM FROM HER BOSOM AND GAVE IT HIM TO KEEP
THE FRESH SPRING BUBBLED FORTH AND MADE A STRANGE GURGLING SOUND
HAVE I THEN FOUND YOU AT LAST BUT HE SAT QUITE STILL BENUMBED AND COLD
THE DROPS OF WATER SPLASHED UP TO THE GREEN LEAFY ROOF AND THE CLERK THOUGHT OF THE MILLION OF EPHEMERA WHICH IN A SINGLE DROP WERE THROWN UP TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS AS GREAT DOUBTLESS FOR THEIR SIZE AS FOR US IF WE WERE TO BE HURLED ABOVE THE CLOUDS
IT IS AN OLD HABIT WITH ME
HOW HAST THOU BEEN ABLE TO FIND THY WAY HITHER HE ASKED
WHILE BELOW LAY A TOWN WHOSE APPEARANCE WE CAN IN SOME MEASURE REALIZE TO OURSELVES BY BEATING THE WHITE OF AN EGG IN A GLASS OF WATER
OTHERWISE THE OLD MAN IN THE PLUSH BREECHES WAS QUITE ALONE IN THE OLD HOUSE
AND IS SO WE SHOULD SAY AS SOFT AS NEWLY-FALLEN SNOW
BORNE BY ELECTRICITY THE SOUL WANTS EVEN SOME MINUTES LESS TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME FLIGHT
AND SHE NEARLY SQUEEZED THE RAVEN TO DEATH SO MUCH DID SHE KISS HIM
YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE FIRST OPERA DANCER
WHEN POP
HUMPY-DUMPY FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE GOT A PRINCESS AND HE THOUGHT AT THE MOMENT OF A NICE LITTLE BIRCH TREE GROWING OUT IN THE WOODS
THE MESSENGER OF FORTUNE HAD ONLY EXECUTED A FEW UNIMPORTANT COMMISSIONS SUCH AS SAVING A NEW BONNET FROM A SHOWER OF RAIN ETC
THE WORD ALONE GERDA UNDERSTOOD QUITE WELL AND FELT HOW MUCH WAS EXPRESSED BY IT
I AM ILL
BUT TWO WINTERS WERE PAST AND IN THE THIRD THE TREE WAS SO LARGE THAT THE HARE WAS OBLIGED TO GO ROUND IT
AND THE NEARER THEY STOOD TO THE DOOR THE PROUDER THEY LOOKED
BUT THE STOMACH WAS EMPTY THE BODY TIRED
CHILDREN AT LEAST IN HEART
AND ON HE WENT BOLDLY UP TO THE PRINCESS WHO WAS SITTING ON A PEARL AS LARGE AS A SPINNING-WHEEL
IF YOU KNOW NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT WE SHALL GIVE THE COMMISSION TO THE WHITE GNATS
SHE HAD A LARGE BROAD-BRIMMED HAT ON PAINTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID FLOWERS
SHE WAS LIGHT BUT HE WAS STILL LIGHTER
IT WAS STILL IN THE WOODS SO VERY STILL
MEANWHILE HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE IDEA--HE SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS SUCH A PAIR OF SPECTACLES HIMSELF
TO KNOW HOW UNHAPPY ALL AT HOME WERE WHEN HE DID NOT COME BACK OH WHAT A FRIGHT AND A JOY IT WAS
THERE WAS A LARGE COMPANY OF RAGS THE FINE BY THEMSELVES AND THE COARSE BY THEMSELVES JUST AS IT SHOULD BE
IT DID NOT HURT ANY LONGER BUT THERE IT WAS
IT IS REALLY TERRIBLY LONELY HERE SQUEAK
AND NOW WE ARE CLOSE TO THE CHURCH
THOSE WERE UNCOUTH BIRDS ANSWERED THE PARROT
WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT THOUGHT THE TREE
THEN GOOD-BYE SAID THE RATS
INTRIGUE ON THE RAMPARTS
I AM COME TO DESPISE THEE SAID HE
BUT WHAT IS IT AND WHERE IS IT TO BE FOUND
THAT WAS KAY
AND WHEN THEY STOOD BEFORE THE THRONE ON WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS SITTING ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO REPEAT THE LAST WORD THEY HAD UTTERED AND TO HEAR IT AGAIN DID NOT INTEREST HER VERY MUCH
AND HERE IS MY DEAR OLD BAC
THERE WAS SUCH A BAWLING AND SCREAMING--THE FIR TREE ALONE WAS SILENT AND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AM I NOT TO BAWL WITH THE REST
I'LL TAKE A HACKNEY-COACH THOUGHT HE
SHE WAS SO DOWNCAST SO AFRAID THAT IT SHOULD DIE
HER LITTLE FEET SHE HAD DRAWN CLOSE UP TO HER BUT SHE GREW COLDER AND COLDER AND TO GO HOME SHE DID NOT VENTURE FOR SHE HAD NOT SOLD ANY MATCHES AND COULD NOT BRING A FARTHING OF MONEY
AND NOW HE SAID CAW
HE SAT THERE NODDED HIS HEAD AND SAID LOOK WHAT BEAUTIFUL DANCING SHOES THEN SHE WAS TERRIFIED AND WANTED TO FLING OFF THE RED SHOES BUT THEY CLUNG FAST
THOSE WERE VERY LONG AND DISMAL WINTER EVENINGS
THICK EVERGREENS GROW ON THE DILAPIDATED WALLS AND AROUND THE ALTAR WHERE A LOVELY MAIDEN IS STANDING
AUTUMN IS COME
THE CHILDREN OFTEN CAME WITH A WHOLE PITCHER FULL OF BERRIES OR A LONG ROW OF THEM THREADED ON A STRAW AND SAT DOWN NEAR THE YOUNG TREE AND SAID OH HOW PRETTY HE IS
WHY THEN WE CAN GO TOGETHER SAID THE KING'S SON
YES THAT IT HAS SAID SHE
NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WAS
AND GERDA WAS SO GLAD TO BE ON DRY LAND AGAIN
HE WAS CONSIDERABLY HEAVIER BUT HE WAS WELL-MANNERED AND WORE A GREEN UNIFORM WHICH HE HAD BY RIGHT OF BIRTH
THE MORNING-STAR THAT IS TO SAY THE HEAVY WOODEN STAFF HEADED WITH IRON SPIKES AND WHICH HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WITH ITS SPARKLING BROTHER IN THE SKY HAD GLIDED FROM HIS HAND
THEY LOOKED LIKE WHITE CORALS
AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED AND LAID THEMSELVES DOWN THEY FORMED EXACTLY THE LETTERS WHICH THE SNOW QUEEN HAD TOLD HIM TO FIND OUT
HAD I SUCH A SUIT I MIGHT AT ONCE FIND OUT WHAT MEN IN MY REALMS ARE UNFIT FOR THEIR OFFICE AND ALSO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE WISE FROM THE FOOLISH
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME SAID THE FLEA
AND THE ORGAN PEALED AND THE CHILDREN'S VOICES IN THE CHOIR SOUNDED SO SWEET AND SOFT
ALWAYS THE SAME TONE SO UNIFORM AND SO TIRING THAT LITTLE TUK FELL INTO A GOOD SOUND SLEEP WHICH BY THE BYE COULD NOT DO HIM ANY HARM
HE HAD BEEN THERE BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT AT HOME
IT WAS AS IF THE STREAM WOULD NOT TAKE WHAT WAS DEAREST TO HER
HOW IT BLOOMED
THAT HOWEVER IS THE GREAT VIRTUE OF THIS DELICATE CLOTH YES INDEED SAID ALL THE COURTIERS ALTHOUGH NOT ONE OF THEM COULD SEE ANYTHING OF THIS EXQUISITE MANUFACTURE
BUT THE ROSE TREE WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL ROSE CAME TO VIEW
YOU ARE HUNGRY NO DOUBT
AN OFFICER WERE I WITH SWORD AND UNIFORM AND PLUME SO HIGH
THE OLD THOUGHTS WITH WHAT THEY MAY BRING WITH THEM COME AND VISIT ME AND NOW YOU ALSO COME
AND THE FINLAND WOMAN WINKED HER EYES BUT SAID NOTHING
EVERY MORNING THERE CAME AN OLD FELLOW TO HIM WHO PUT HIS ROOMS IN ORDER AND WENT ON ERRANDS
SHE LIVED BEHIND THE EXCHANGE
SHE THEREFORE WENT OUT IN THE GARDEN STRETCHED OUT HER CROOKED STICK TOWARDS THE ROSE-BUSHES WHICH BEAUTIFULLY AS THEY WERE BLOWING ALL SANK INTO THE EARTH AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE THEY HAD STOOD
AND NOW SOMETHING HAS GOT INTO MY EYE THE LITTLE GIRL PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
THEY WERE NOT ELFIN MAIDENS BUT MORTAL CHILDREN
BUT I WILL SOON COME HOME AND THEN I WILL BRING KAY WITH ME
THIS REPLY FULLY SATISFIED THE COUNCILLOR
I CANNOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER
AND SCHNIPP-SCHNAPP-SCHNURRE-BASSELURRE SAID THE ROBBER MAIDEN
THEN I WILL DO SOMETHING FOR YOU SHE NOW JUMPED OUT OF BED FLEW TO HER MOTHER
HIS MENTAL POWERS HERE BELOW WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE TREASURES LYING BEYOND THIS LIFE AND WHICH HIS DESTINY ORDAINED HE SHOULD OBTAIN
KJOGE A TOWN IN THE BAY OF KJOGE
DO MY NEW CLOTHES FIT WELL ASKED HE TURNING HIMSELF ROUND AGAIN BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT APPEAR TO BE EXAMINING HIS HANDSOME SUIT
STALE EGGS AND ROASTED COCKS'-COMBS FURNISHED THE GRAND DISH OF THE REPAST
THEN THE BOY RECOVERED HIS CHEEKS AGAIN GREW ROSY HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE LAP WHERE HE WAS SITTING AND DANCED ROUND THE KIND OLD POET
BUT MY MOTHER IS STILL HERE AND WILL REMAIN
THE DOOR STANDS HALF-OPEN
BUT HE MUST AWAY TO THE NEXT HEART
AS THE OLD MAN TREMBLED WITH COLD AND THE LITTLE CHILD SLEPT A MOMENT THE MOTHER WENT AND POURED SOME ALE INTO A POT AND SET IT ON THE STOVE THAT IT MIGHT BE WARM FOR HIM
I SHOULD LIKE TO GO OUT A LITTLE HE GOT THE GALOSHES AND HE WAS SOON BELOW IN A LITTLE DUODECIMO GARDEN WHERE BETWEEN TWO IMMENSE WALLS A PLUMTREE AND AN APPLE-TREE WERE STANDING
IT IS RICH AND SPLENDID WHEN IT IS GIVEN US BUT VIEWED BY DAYLIGHT WE FIND ONLY WITHERED LEAVES
YOU MUST TRAVEL
BUT NOW TIS PAST TIS PAST AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES
AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING
HOW I CREAK
HE HAD PLACED THE LIGHT DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM FOR HE KNEW THAT THE SHADOW WOULD ALWAYS HAVE ITS MASTER FOR A SCREEN BUT HE COULD NOT ENTICE IT
AND NOW WE ARE BY THE SMITHY WHERE THE FIRE IS BLAZING AND WHERE THE HALF-NAKED MEN ARE BANGING WITH THEIR HAMMERS TILL THE SPARKS FLY ABOUT
THE COVER ROSE MORE AND MORE
THE STEPS ARE AS BROAD AS THOSE OF A PALACE AND AS HIGH AS TO A CHURCH TOWER
WERE THAT NOT THE CASE YOU KNOW MY MAGNIFICENT ELDERBUSH COULD NOT HAVE GROWN OUT OF THE TEA-POT AND THEN SHE TOOK THE LITTLE BOY OUT OF BED LAID HIM ON HER BOSOM AND THE BRANCHES OF THE ELDER TREE FULL OF FLOWERS CLOSED AROUND HER
HE FELT A PANG--IT WAS LIKE A SWOON
BUT YOU MUST MAKE GOOD USE OF YOUR LEGS
THE LITTLE MAIDEN STRETCHED OUT HER HANDS TOWARDS THEM WHEN--THE MATCH WENT OUT
HE IS BRAVE AND INTELLECTUAL AND SO HE WON THE PRINCESS
THE QUESTION NOW WAS IF HE COULD SQUEEZE HIMSELF THROUGH THE GRATING FOR HE HAD NEVER TRIED BEFORE
BUT I BECAME SO
THE MOST WONDERFUL FAIRY TALES GROW OUT OF THAT WHICH IS REALITY
IT WAS HIS NEIGHBOR A YOUNG DIVINE WHO LIVED ON THE SAME FLOOR
HE OUGHT TO BE SURE TO HAVE READ OVER HIS LESSON AGAIN BUT THAT YOU KNOW HE COULD NOT DO
IT FLIES NINETEEN MILLION TIMES FASTER THAN THE BEST RACE-HORSE
PRESENTLY SHE SAILED BY A LARGE CHERRY-ORCHARD WHERE WAS A LITTLE COTTAGE WITH CURIOUS RED AND BLUE WINDOWS
AND WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TO SET OFF A NEW CARRIAGE STOPPED BEFORE THE DOOR
THEN I WILL DO IT MYSELF
I ONCE INTENDED TO EQUIP A SHIP THAT WAS TO SAIL ALL ROUND THE EARTH
THE FIR TREE OUT IN THE WOODS STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE
HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE
YET I KNOW IN REALITY WHAT IT IS I WISH FOR
BUT THE CARRIAGE SHONE LIKE A TORCH AND IT DAZZLED THE EYES OF THE ROBBERS SO THAT THEY COULD NOT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT
THAT WOULD BE THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN--OH
THE ELDERBUSH ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY WHO HAD TAKEN COLD
AND WHEN HER WARM TEARS WATERED THE GROUND THE TREE SHOT UP SUDDENLY AS FRESH AND BLOOMING AS WHEN IT HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP
I RAN ABOUT THE STREETS IN THE MOONLIGHT
YES YOU SEE I HAVE EVEN GIVEN HIM A SHADOW
THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES ARE READY AND NOW THE EMPEROR WITH ALL THE GRANDEES OF HIS COURT CAME TO THE WEAVERS
AND THERE LIVED AN OLD MAN WHO WORE PLUSH BREECHES
WE DO NOT TOLL FOR LITTLE KAY
I FEEL SUCH A SHARP PAIN IN MY HEART
THE NAUGHTY BOY ALONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD POET A THOROUGHLY KIND OLD POET
ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE DEAD AND THE LITTLE BOY KISSED HIS HAND TO THE COFFIN AS IT WAS DRIVEN AWAY
BUT DO YOU ALL STAND BEFORE ME THAT NO ONE MAY SEE US AND THE COURT-LADIES PLACED THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF HER AND SPREAD OUT THEIR DRESSES--THE SWINEHERD GOT TEN KISSES AND THE PRINCESS--THE KITCHEN-POT
HE IS FOREVER RUNNING AFTER EVERYBODY
FULL OF LONGING SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND AS SOON AS IT VANISHED ROLLED HER TENDER LEAVES TOGETHER AND SLEPT IN THE EMBRACES OF THE AIR
EVERY EVENING I TICKLE HIS NECK WITH MY SHARP KNIFE
AH SAID HE AT ONCE THAT ROSE IS CANKERED
THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN LOOKED AT HER WITH A SERIOUS AIR NODDED HER HEAD SLIGHTLY AND SAID THEY SHALL NOT KILL YOU EVEN IF I AM ANGRY WITH YOU
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A RUSSIAN BATH MIGHT DO ME GOOD
IT WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS STANDING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
THAT WAS KING HROAR NEAR THE FOUNTAINS CLOSE TO THE TOWN OF ROESKILDE AS IT IS NOW CALLED
I WOULD NOT BE A MAN IF IT WERE NOT NOW ONCE ACCEPTED AND REGARDED AS SOMETHING TO BE SO
ON THEY WENT QUICKER AND QUICKER INTO THE NEXT STREET
HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP IN
IT WAS NOT A VERY POLITE EPISTLE FROM THE MANAGER OF A THEATRE IN WHICH BOTH PIECES WERE FLATLY REFUSED
HE TREMBLED WITH COLD AND HAD HE NOT COME INTO A WARM ROOM HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE PERISHED IN THE FRIGHTFUL TEMPEST
REJOICE IN THY VIGOROUS GROWTH AND IN THE FRESH LIFE THAT MOVETH WITHIN THEE AND THE WIND KISSED THE TREE AND THE DEW WEPT TEARS OVER HIM
IT IS DELIGHTFUL HERE IN WINTER SAID THE LITTLE MAIDEN
HE FELT THE FRESH AIR THE FIRST SUNBEAM--AND NOW HE WAS OUT IN THE COURTYARD
BUT THAT THE END OF IT LIKE THE RHINE WAS VERY INSIGNIFICANT PROVED IN HIS OPINION THE AUTHOR'S WANT OF INVENTION
IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING AND THAT IN FUTURE KAREN SHOULD ONLY GO IN BLACK SHOES TO CHURCH EVEN WHEN SHE SHOULD BE OLDER
KISS IT CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL AND FLUNG THE PIGEON IN GERDA'S FACE
THEN AT LAST WOULD THE AGONIZING RESTLESSNESS BE ALLAYED WHICH DESTROYS MY EXISTENCE
THE LATTER LIVES THERE STILL
NOW YOU WILL HAVE NO MORE KISSES SAID SHE OR ELSE I SHOULD KISS YOU TO DEATH KAY LOOKED AT HER
AND SHE SANG THE VERSE TO THE LITTLE BOY WHO THEN SANG IT WITH HER
THE SHADOW ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO KEEP ITSELF IN THE MASTER'S PLACE
THE LITTLE ONES STOOD QUITE STILL
AND SHE SAID DEATH HAS BEEN IN THY CHAMBER AND I SAW HIM HASTEN AWAY WITH THY LITTLE CHILD
THERE IS MORE DONE FOR US THAN FOR ALL OTHER CREATURES SURE ENOUGH
ALTHOUGH THEY STILL DID NOT PASS A SINGLE THREAD THROUGH THE LOOMS
WHAT IS IT LIKE THAT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO EXPLAIN SAID THE STORK AND WITH THESE WORDS OFF HE WENT
SHE STOOD ON THE BALCONY AND SHONE AS THE AURORA BOREALIS SHINES
THEN IT WAS SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AMONG THE TREES AND SHE FANCIED IT MUST BE THE MOON FOR THERE WAS A FACE
AFTER THIS SPEECH WAS MADE THE OLD ONES CREPT INTO THEIR SHELLS AND NEVER MORE CAME OUT
SO THEY CAME TO A WATERING-PLACE WHERE THERE WERE MANY STRANGERS AND AMONGST THEM WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS TROUBLED WITH SEEING TOO WELL
SHE FOLDED HER LITTLE HANDS AND THOUGHT HOW GOOD MEN AND ANIMALS ARE AND SHE THEN FELL ASLEEP AND SLEPT SOUNDLY
AND THERE IS AN ELDER TREE STANDING BESIDE IT
AND THE POOR LITTLE THING LOST THEM AS SHE SCUFFLED AWAY ACROSS THE STREET BECAUSE OF TWO CARRIAGES THAT ROLLED BY DREADFULLY FAST
SO THE COPYING-CLERK CAME TO COPENHAGEN AS GUEST OR RATHER AS PRISONER IN A FAMILY LIVING IN GOTHER STREET
AND THE LORDS OF THE BEDCHAMBER TOOK GREATER PAINS THAN EVER TO APPEAR HOLDING UP A TRAIN ALTHOUGH IN REALITY THERE WAS NO TRAIN TO HOLD
HE WAS NOW TO GO TO BED
ALL THE LITTLE SPRITES WHO WENT TO HIS SCHOOL--FOR HE KEPT A SPRITE SCHOOL--TOLD EACH OTHER THAT A MIRACLE HAD HAPPENED
IT WAS LIKE SHADOWY FIGURES ON THE WALL
BUT ALL AT ONCE SHE COWERED TOGETHER AND HER HEAD BEGAN SHAKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND SHE LOOKED AS SHE WERE GOING TO MAKE A SPRING
AND THEY TOO NOW BEGAN TO THINK THEM NOT SO VERY AMUSING EITHER
ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AT FIRST THEY WERE SERVANTS COME TO ACCOMPANY THEIR MISTRESSES HOME
HE WAS NOW IN THE HEART OF THE WIFE OF THIS WORTHY GENTLEMAN
BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND HANDSOME
THERE STOOD FINE HYACINTHS UNDER GLASS BELLS AND THERE STOOD STRONG-STEMMED PEONIES
NO ONE LOOKED AT THE TREE EXCEPT THE OLD NURSE WHO PEEPED BETWEEN THE BRANCHES
NEVER HAD HIS AGE WITH WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS ALWAYS GRUMBLING SEEMED SO MISERABLE AS ON THIS EVENING
BUT HE REMINDS ME OF A STORY ABOUT A PEWTER SOLDIER WHICH I HAD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND THEN HE TOLD HIS WIFE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE AND THE OLD MAN AND ABOUT THE PEWTER SOLDIER THAT HE SENT OVER TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS SO VERY VERY LONELY
IN A FEW SECONDS THE WATCHMAN HAD DONE THE FIFTY-TWO THOUSAND OF OUR MILES UP TO THE MOON WHICH AS EVERYONE KNOWS WAS FORMED OUT OF MATTER MUCH LIGHTER THAN OUR EARTH
SO THEY FELL UPON IT WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT ALL ITS BRANCHES CRACKED
BUT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE
AND HE TOLD IT AS CORRECTLY AS IT HAD REALLY BEEN SO THAT THE TEARS CAME INTO THE EYES OF HIS YOUNG WIFE ON ACCOUNT OF THE OLD HOUSE AND THE OLD MAN
THE EMPEROR WAS VEXED FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE RIGHT
FOR IF I DON'T I SHALL NEVER GET SAFE TO CHRISTIANSHAFEN SO OFF HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF EAST STREET AND HAD NEARLY GOT TO THE END OF IT WHEN THE MOON SHONE FORTH
A RUSTLING WAS HEARD IN THE BUSHES AND A LITTLE BOY STOOD BEFORE THE KING'S SON A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD
THE POT WAS BOILING THE WHOLE EVENING AND THE WHOLE OF THE FOLLOWING DAY
THE OTHER HAD BEEN LAID HOLD OF BY AN URCHIN AND OFF HE RAN WITH IT
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY KILLED IF I HAD GONE OVER TO THE MAIDEN
HE HAD ON THE SHOES
THE OLD WOMAN HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT FROM HER HAT WHEN SHE MADE THE OTHERS VANISH IN THE EARTH
THE WHITE DRESS IS HANGING ON THE HOOK
AND FOR THE SUFFERER THERE IS NOTHING LEFT BUT THE GREEN MOUND THAT O'ER THE COFFIN LIES TWO FIGURES WERE MOVING IN THE CHAMBER
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN
BUT THE LITTLE ONE WOULD NOT GROW FOR HE WAS OF A COMMON FAMILY
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW FAR IT EXTENDS AND WHAT THERE IS OUTSIDE THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL SAID FATHER SNAIL
THEY LOOKED ALMOST MELANCHOLY
I MISSED MY GOOD OLD MOTHER AND THE DEAR LITTLE ONES
SHALL WE THRASH HIM
AND SHE WENT TO THE PARSONAGE AND BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HER INTO SERVICE
BUT I KNOW FROM MY TAME SWEETHEART THAT WHEN HE CAME INTO THE COURT-YARD OF THE PALACE AND SAW THE BODY-GUARD IN SILVER THE LACKEYS ON THE STAIRCASE HE WAS NOT THE LEAST ABASHED
AND THEN ASKED HIM WHETHER THE DESIGN PLEASED HIM AND WHETHER THE COLORS WERE NOT VERY BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS EAST STREET SPLENDID AND ELEGANT AS WE NOW SEE IT
THEY TOOK EACH OTHER BY THE HAND AND WANDERED FORTH OUT OF THE LARGE HALL
AND OLD NANNY NODDED IN THE BUSH AND SHOUTED HURRAH WITH THE REST BUT THAT IS NO FAIRY TALE SAID THE LITTLE BOY WHO WAS LISTENING TO THE STORY
IT WAS CERTAINLY RATHER COOL OF HIM TO SAY TO THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WILL YOU HAVE ME BUT SO HE DID
BUT A MIDSHIPMAN IT WAS NOT
IT WAS NOON
WHEREVER I GO I AM PURSUED BY A LONGING THAT IS INSATIABLE--THAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO MYSELF AND THAT TEARS MY VERY HEART
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE NEW BOOTHS HAVE A MUCH BETTER NAME FOR HER
THE SHOES AS IS THE CASE WITH ANYBODY WHO DOES WHAT HE HAS TO DO PROPERLY COULD ONLY ATTEND TO ONE THING AT A TIME
EVEN THE HOSTESS WITH BARE FEET UNCOMBED HAIR AND DRESSED IN A GARMENT OF DOUBTFUL COLOR RECEIVED THE GUESTS GRUMBLINGLY
AND AT LAST ONLY A SINGLE ONE REMAINED STANDING WHERE THE CASTLE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THE TOWN WAS SO SMALL AND POOR AND THE SCHOOL BOYS CAME ALONG WITH THEIR BOOKS UNDER THEIR ARMS AND SAID 2000 INHABITANTS BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE FOR THERE WERE NOT SO MANY
HE HAS NOT COME HERE YET SAID THE OLD GRAVE WOMAN WHO WAS APPOINTED TO LOOK AFTER DEATH'S GREAT GREENHOUSE
AND HIS MOTHER LAUGHED PUT SOME ELDER-FLOWERS IN THE TEA-POT AND POURED BOILING WATER UPON THEM
THE NEWSPAPERS APPEARED FORTHWITH WITH A BORDER OF HEARTS AND THE INITIALS OF THE PRINCESS
AM I A SIMPLETON OR AM I UNFIT TO BE AN EMPEROR
I HAVE NEVER HEARD PRETTIER COMPOSITIONS
THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET AND ANGELS DESCEND THERE THE CHILDREN TO GREET AND THE CHILDREN HELD EACH OTHER BY THE HAND KISSED THE ROSES LOOKED UP AT THE CLEAR SUNSHINE AND SPOKE AS THOUGH THEY REALLY SAW ANGELS THERE
SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER MUST FOLLOW--BUT WHAT
AND SHE WEPT STILL MORE AND HER EYES SUNK DOWN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE WATERS AND BECAME TWO PRECIOUS PEARLS
WHAT'S TO BE THE END OF THIS
SHE PLEASED HIM AND HE PLEASED HER YES YES
LOOK THROUGH THIS GLASS GERDA SAID HE
YOU WILL BE A RICH AND HAPPY MAN
AND BOTH PRINCESS AND SWINEHERD WERE THRUST OUT OF THE CITY
AND IN THE MIDDLE FROM A THICK GOLDEN STEM HUNG TWO BEDS EACH OF WHICH RESEMBLED A LILY
AND THEN HE FELT IT AND FOUND THE GOOD DAME WAS RIGHT
THE SWING MOVES AND THE BUBBLES FLOAT IN CHARMING CHANGING COLORS
YES IF YOU CAN TELL ME EXACTLY--FOR I MUST KNOW THAT FIRST--HOW DEEP THE GUTTER IS IN THE LITTLE STREET OPPOSITE THAT YOU PASS THROUGH IN GOING TO SCHOOL JUST UP TO THE MIDDLE OF MY BOOT SAID THE CHILD
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
IN REALITY HIS NAME WAS NOT TUK BUT THAT WAS WHAT HE CALLED HIMSELF BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK PLAIN
HE HAS NOW FOLLOWED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS AND LISTENED TO MY CONVERSATION--I SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE
I AM COLD AND I'M SO WET EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY A CHILD THAT STOOD CRYING AT THE DOOR AND KNOCKING FOR ADMITTANCE WHILE THE RAIN POURED DOWN AND THE WIND MADE ALL THE WINDOWS RATTLE
WHO THEN RELATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER AND HOW MUCH SHE CARED ABOUT LITTLE KAY
WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE UP THE ROOM THE SHOES DANCED BACK AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE
NO PLACE SEEMING TO HIM MORE FITTED FOR SUCH A TRIAL
SHE KISSED HIS HANDS AND FEET AND HE WAS AGAIN WELL AND MERRY
DO YOU THINK HE IS DEAD AND GONE DEAD HE CERTAINLY IS NOT SAID THE ROSES
AND HE SAID TOO YES A FINE EXTERIOR IS EVERYTHING--A FINE EXTERIOR IS WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT AND THEN HE BEGAN CHIRPING HIS PECULIAR MELANCHOLY SONG FROM WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN THIS HISTORY
HERE GIVE ME THE LITTLE GIRL
WHERE STOOD LARGE GLASS-CASES FILLED WITH ELEGANT SHOES AND BRILLIANT BOOTS
HOW SPLENDID AND LIGHT IT IS
WHILE BY DAY HE SLEPT AT THE FEET OF THE SNOW QUEEN
HE WILL NO DOUBT BE GLAD TO SEE YOU--TO HEAR WHAT A LONG WAY YOU HAVE COME FOR HIS SAKE
THE EXTENSIVE BUILDING IS SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY A PRETTY HIGH RAILING THE THICK IRON BARS OF WHICH ARE SO FAR APART THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS IT IS SAID SOME VERY THIN FELLOW HAD OF A NIGHT OCCASIONALLY SQUEEZED HIMSELF THROUGH TO GO AND PAY HIS LITTLE VISITS IN THE TOWN
AND THAT WAS WISELY THOUGHT
THE COLD WAS SO INTENSE THAT SHE COULD SEE HER OWN BREATH WHICH CAME LIKE SMOKE OUT OF HER MOUTH
WHERE DID I GET ALL THIS RUBBISH
CARE VANISHED AND WITH HER THE GALOSHES
NOW I SHALL CERTAINLY GET THE GOUT LIKE THE OLD CLOTHESPRESS UGH AND THEN THE LITTLE BOY CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE PROJECTING WINDOWS WERE AND WHERE THE OLD MAN SAT
HE HAS A WHOLE FOREST OF BURDOCKS SHE HAS ONLY A BUSH AND SO THEY WENT AND FETCHED LITTLE MISS SNAIL
NEVER A LITTLE TEA-PARTY OF WHITE YOUNG LADY FOXES
I AM HIS GARDENER I TAKE ALL HIS FLOWERS AND TREES AND PLANT THEM OUT IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF PARADISE IN THE UNKNOWN LAND
AND AS NO ONE CONTRADICTED THEM SO OF COURSE IT WAS SO
UPON THIS BED THE PRINCESS WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT
THE GATE WAS LOCKED BUT SHE SHOOK THE RUSTED BOLT TILL IT WAS LOOSENED AND THE GATE OPENED
OH TAKE ME WITH YOU
AND WHEN AT LAST YOU SINK INTO YOUR GRAVE YOU SHALL SLEEP AS QUIETLY AS IF I LAY IN SOROE SAID TUK AWAKING
AND THE NEXT NIGHT THEY CAME WITH FOUR OTHER LITTLE MICE WHO WERE TO HEAR WHAT THE TREE RECOUNTED
THE STREET BOYS WERE SCREAMING AND HOOTING AND SHOUTING AND SHOOTING WITH DEVILS AND DETONATING BALLS--AND THERE CAME CORPSE BEARERS AND HOOD WEARERS--FOR THERE WERE FUNERALS WITH PSALM AND HYMN--AND THEN THE DIN OF CARRIAGES DRIVING AND COMPANY ARRIVING
YET HE STILL HEARD THE PEALING TONES OF THE ORGAN AND HE HIMSELF SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME A NEWER AND A BETTER MAN
THEY POURED OUT THE LIQUOR AND MADE THE MOST FRIENDLY GESTICULATIONS
IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH
THE SWEET AIR CONTINUED HE OF THE POLICE-OFFICE IN HIS DREAMY IMAGININGS
YOU SEE NOW THAT MY BOW WAS NOT SPOILED SAID HE LAUGHING
SHALL WE THRASH HIM SAID THEY
IT IS TOO MELANCHOLY
THE CEILING OF THE ROOM RESEMBLED A LARGE PALM-TREE WITH LEAVES OF GLASS OF COSTLY GLASS
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THE SHADOW WAS GONE BUT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WITHOUT A SHADOW IT WAS KNOWN TO EVERYBODY AT HOME IN THE COLD LANDS
DANCE SHALT THOU SAID HE
BUT HE NEVER COULD MANAGE TO REPRESENT JUST THE WORD HE WANTED--THAT WORD WAS ETERNITY
SHE KISSED THE BOY AND NOW THEY WERE OF THE SAME AGE AND FELT ALIKE
BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL
SHE HAD WEPT HER EYES OUT
SO NOW HE WAS HIS OWN MASTER AND HE WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE WORLD AND A PAIR OF NEW SKATES INTO THE BARGAIN
THE RIGHT SORT COME OF THEMSELVES
YES THAT WAS A PICTURE BOOK
HOWEVER I WILL UNTETHER YOU AND HELP YOU OUT SO THAT YOU MAY GO BACK TO LAPLAND
THE OTHERS WERE EITHER BLIND HAD WITHERED LEGS AND CREPT ABOUT ON THEIR HANDS OR WITHERED ARMS AND FINGERLESS HANDS
THE BRIGHT BLAZE OF A FIRE SHOT UP FROM TIME TO TIME AND ITS RUDDY GLEAMS SEEMED TO CONTEND WITH THE BLUISH LIGHT OF THE TORCHES
I WON'T TREMBLE TO-MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
DO YOU NOW SEE SAID CARE WHAT HAPPINESS YOUR GALOSHES HAVE BROUGHT TO MANKIND TO HIM AT LEAST WHO SLUMBERS HERE THEY HAVE BROUGHT AN IMPERISHABLE BLESSING ANSWERED THE OTHER
AT LEAST ON EVERY SIDE AND ABOVE AND BELOW THERE WAS NOUGHT BUT FLESH
THE CHILDREN DANCED ABOUT WITH THEIR BEAUTIFUL PLAYTHINGS
SHE HAD NEITHER A TRAIN NOR A GOLDEN CROWN BUT SPLENDID RED MOROCCO SHOES
BUM
BUM
BUM
BUM
THEY BOTH LOOKED SO ROSY-CHEEKED
AND THE FIRST GREEN BUDS APPEARED THE FIRST LITTLE BIRDS BEGAN TO CHIRRUP
THIS HE HAD DONE AND WAS NOW GOING ON IN WOODEN SHOES AND IN HIS HUMBLE DRESS FOR THE BELL SOUNDED WITH SO DEEP A TONE AND WITH SUCH STRANGE POWER THAT PROCEED HE MUST
YES SHE IS LONGING FOR ME NO DOUBT
HOW NAUGHTY A BOY CUPID IS
ACROSS TO THE HOLME SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE AT THAT MOMENT WAS
THE HOUSE WAS FILLED TO SUFFOCATION
WOULD TO HEAVEN I COULD BUT CHANGE WITH HIM
IT WAS A WARM BRIGHT FLAME LIKE A CANDLE AS SHE HELD HER HANDS OVER IT
THE LARGEST WAS MANY MILES IN EXTENT
THEY DREW A LITTLE SLEDGE IN WHICH LITTLE KAY SAT AND NODDED HIS HEAD
THE BELL HAS A TONE THAT IS WONDROUS SWEET
DDSA
DDSA
THE ROOF REACHED TO THE GROUND
THEY WERE TELLING EACH OTHER WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DURING THE DAY
WHEN KAY HEARS THAT I AM HERE HE WILL COME OUT DIRECTLY TO FETCH ME WAIT FOR ME HERE ON THESE STEPS SAID THE RAVEN
I HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING POESY CRIED THE LEARNED MAN
BUT SHE HAD NOT GOT FARTHER THAN THE CHURCHYARD GATE BEFORE SHE SAW THE RED SHOES DANCING BEFORE HER
ALL WERE OF DAZZLING WHITENESS--ALL WERE LIVING SNOW-FLAKES
ALL AT ONCE HE WAS ON HORSEBACK
FOR SHE COULD PLAY LIEBER AUGUSTINE
NATURE SEEMS ANEW TO CELEBRATE HER AWAKENING INTO LIFE
A SWEET FRAGRANCE WAS SMELT AND THE MAIDENS VANISHED IN THE WOOD
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OF OUR SPECIES AT A GREAT DISTANCE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE BURDOCK FOREST BLACK SNAILS I DARE SAY THERE ARE ENOUGH OF SAID THE OLD ONE
THITHER I SAW DEATH TAKE HIS WAY WITH THY LITTLE CHILD THE ROADS CROSSED EACH OTHER IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST AND SHE NO LONGER KNEW WHITHER SHE SHOULD GO
NAY SAID THE COLLAR
IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT
SHE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE WAGES ONLY SHE WISHED TO HAVE A HOME AND BE WITH GOOD PEOPLE
MANY A WINTER'S NIGHT SHE FLIES THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE TOWN AND PEEPS IN AT THE WINDOWS
I WANT SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT IS BUT WHAT IS FLED IN AN INSTANT
III
I CAN SEE NOTHING
IT WAS THE HEART OF A YOUNG MILITARY MAN
SHE DANCED ROUND THE CHURCH CORNER SHE COULD NOT LEAVE OFF
I THINK IT IS OUT NOW SAID HE
IF I HAD BUT MARRIED THE HANDSOME YOUNG PRINCE
YOU HAVE GENIUS
HIS COUNTENANCE WAS SEVERE AND GRAVE
SO THAT THE SHADOW MADE A STRANGE FACE
THEY RAN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND STOOD TOGETHER HAND IN HAND IN THE VAST CHURCH OF NATURE AND OF POETRY WHILE OVER THEM SOUNDED THE INVISIBLE HOLY BELL
HE WAS WITHOUT GENIUS ETC
THERE SAT SOMETHING POINTED STRAIGHT OUT OF THE SOFT MOULD
AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO DECLARE HERSELF BUT SHE WAS DISCREET
I WILL TRY IT DIRECTLY AND HE BENT HIS BOW TOOK AIM AND SHOT AN ARROW AT THE OLD POET RIGHT INTO HIS HEART
IF A GOOD THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH A MAN'S MIND THEN A GRIN WAS SEEN IN THE MIRROR AND THE SPRITE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT HIS CLEVER DISCOVERY
YOU RELATED SO MUCH AND I SAW IT ALL THE WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND I STANDING THERE WITH THE DUST-BOX
IN THE COURSE OF THREE WEEKS HE HAD A VERY FAIR SHADOW WHICH WHEN HE SET OUT FOR HIS HOME IN THE NORTHERN LANDS GREW MORE AND MORE IN THE JOURNEY SO THAT AT LAST IT WAS SO LONG AND SO LARGE THAT IT WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
YES SHE COULD SING THAT SAID HE AND NODDED TO THE PORTRAIT WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT AT THE BROKER'S AND THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHONE SO BRIGHT
AT VARIANCE WITH HIMSELF WITH HIS COMPANY WITH THE COUNTRY AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT
BUT FOR HER THERE WAS NEITHER PEACE NOR REST
ONE FELL DOWN AND FORMED A LONG TRAIL OF FIRE
THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN WOUND HER ARM ROUND GERDA'S NECK HELD THE KNIFE IN THE OTHER HAND AND SNORED SO LOUD THAT EVERYBODY COULD HEAR HER
IF ONLY TO-MORROW ON AWAKING I COULD AGAIN CALL ALL TO MIND SO VIVIDLY
AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER-BOOK
THEN SHE KNEW THAT THE OLD LADY WAS DEAD AND FELT THAT SHE WAS ABANDONED BY ALL AND CONDEMNED BY THE ANGEL OF GOD
THEY DANCED ROUND THE TREE AND ONE PRESENT AFTER THE OTHER WAS PULLED OFF
AND MANY HAD A THATCHED ROOF
HE SAID TO HIMSELF CONSOLINGLY WHILE HIS EYE RAN OVER THE FIRST PAGE
AND THE GREAT BULL-DOGS EACH OF WHICH LOOKED AS IF HE COULD SWALLOW A MAN JUMPED UP BUT THEY DID NOT BARK FOR THAT WAS FORBIDDEN
TO THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY-SEAT AND ALL THAT THE LITTLE MAIDEN WHO SAT BEHIND ON THE STICK SPOKE OF FLEW BY IN REALITY
THE BEAMS GLIDED DOWN THE WHITE WALLS OF A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE AND CLOSE BY THE FRESH YELLOW FLOWERS WERE GROWING SHINING LIKE GOLD IN THE WARM SUN-RAYS
SHE SHALL PLAY WITH ME SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER CHILD
WE WATERED THE SLIPS AND ONE OF THEM WAS AN ELDERBUSH
THEY CONSIDERED THE MOON ALONE TO BE INHABITED
FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS
THE NEXT DAY IT WAS A SHARP FROST--AND THEN THE SPRING CAME
HE THOUGHT THE BELL SOUNDED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THESE STILL LAKES
AND AT LAST THERE WAS NOT A LAND OR A PERSON WHO WAS NOT REPRESENTED DISTORTED IN THE MIRROR
A CERTAIN PERSON HAD AN AUNT WHO BOASTED OF PARTICULAR SKILL IN FORTUNE-TELLING WITH CARDS AND WHO WAS CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY PERSONS THAT WANTED TO HAVE A PEEP INTO FUTURITY
BUT WHEN ONE HAS BEEN IN A FAMILY CIRCLE ONE CANNOT ACCUSTOM ONESELF TO THIS LIFE
THERE WAS GOLD PURE VIRGIN GOLD IN THAT BLESSED KISS
YET PERHAPS I MAY BE ABLE ONCE MORE TO SEE THE ROUND RED SUN BEFORE HE ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
I TOOK MY WAY--I TELL IT TO YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT PUT IT IN ANY BOOK--I TOOK MY WAY TO THE CAKE WOMAN--I HID MYSELF BEHIND HER
AND EVERYONE WAS UNCOMMONLY GAY
THEY TOOK HOLD OF THE WORTHY MAN
HOW DELICIOUS FOR THEY THOUGHT IT TASTED SO DELICATE--LIVED ON DOCK-LEAVES AND THEREFORE BURDOCK SEEDS WERE SOWN
DANCE SHALT THOU MERCY CRIED KAREN
AND TAKE THIS LITTLE GIRL FOR ME TO THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN WHERE HER PLAYFELLOW IS
TO FLY MUST BE A HEAVENLY ART
IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL ONLY BE PLEASED TO LOOK AT IT
ALL WOULD BE SPLENDIDLY DECKED OUT AND WE SHOULD HEAR WALK IN GENTLEMEN PRAY WALK IN
WERE I BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SO SAYING HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE IN ITALY BETWEEN FLORENCE AND ROME
THERE IS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IN IT YOU MAY BE SURE THE MANOR-HOUSE HAS MOST LIKELY FALLEN TO RUIN SAID FATHER SNAIL
THAT DAY PASSED AND THE LITTLE BOY WENT HOME AND THAT WEEK PASSED AND SEVERAL WEEKS TOO
AND IT SEEMED TO BOTH OF THEM IT CONTAINED MUCH THAT RESEMBLED THEIR OWN HISTORY
TRATERATRA AND THE SWORDS AND ARMOR ON THE KNIGHTS PORTRAITS RATTLED AND THE SILK GOWNS RUSTLED
THAT MUST BE PATENT LEATHER SAID THE OLD LADY
WE DO NOT KNOW HIM
ON THE TABLE STOOD THE MOST EXQUISITE CHERRIES AND GERDA ATE AS MANY AS SHE CHOSE FOR SHE HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO
WHEREFORE HE STARTED UP AS IN A FEVER
THE IMPOSTORS REQUESTED HIM VERY COURTEOUSLY TO BE SO GOOD AS TO COME NEARER THEIR LOOMS
OH WHAT ODOUR AND WHAT LOVELINESS WAS THERE
THEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL SO THICKLY THAT THE LITTLE BOY COULD NOT SEE AN ARM'S LENGTH BEFORE HIM BUT STILL ON HE WENT
TO CRY ALOUD FOR HELP WOULD HAVE AVAILED HIM LITTLE
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE IS NO DOUBT GONE TO LAPLAND
OH WERE I RICH IN CALM AND PEACE OF MIND MY GRIEF YOU THEN WOULD NOT HERE WRITTEN FIND
FOR OTHERWISE THE HEAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT--AND AFTER LAYING A PIECE OF ICE ON THE REINDEER'S HEAD READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE FISH-SKIN
BUT HE NO LONGER CARRIED THE SHARP SWORD BUT IN ITS STEAD A SPLENDID GREEN SPRAY FULL OF ROSES
HE LOOKED AT HER AND SHE SANG THE HYMN
THEY ARE GONE ABROAD SAID THE OTHER
AND NO ONE MUST KNOW IT NOW IF I AM SO
PULLED HIS CAP OVER HIS EARS AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
BOTH OF THEM ARE GOD'S WILL SAID DEATH
HE WHO HAD TAKEN HIM INTO HIS WARM ROOM WHO HAD TREATED HIM SO KINDLY AND WHO HAD GIVEN HIM WARM WINE AND THE VERY BEST APPLES
BUT TWO OF THE YOUNGEST SOON GREW TIRED AND BOTH RETURNED TO TOWN
ONE MUST HAVE MORE THAN THE EYE OF A SHOEMAKER TO KNOW ONE PAIR FROM THE OTHER SAID HE SOLILOQUIZING
AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN ENTERED THE VAST EMPTY COLD HALLS
AS TO OURSELVES WE ALL KNOW THE SPEED PRODUCED BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF STEAM
MOST HAPPY WERE I COULD I BUT REACH ONE AIM--COULD BUT REACH THE HAPPIEST OF ALL AND AS HE SPOKE THE WORD HE WAS AGAIN IN HIS HOME
HE GAZED AT THE STREET FORMERLY SO WELL KNOWN TO HIM AND NOW SO STRANGE IN APPEARANCE AND LOOKED AT THE HOUSES MORE ATTENTIVELY
THERE LAY THE ELDER-BLOSSOM AS FRESH AS IF IT HAD BEEN PLACED THERE BUT A SHORT TIME BEFORE
AND THE LEARNED MAN TREMBLED FOR HE THOUGHT OF IT
THE LEARNED FOREIGNER THOUGHT IT QUITE MARVELLOUS BUT NOW--IT MIGHT BE THAT HE ONLY IMAGINED IT--FOR HE FOUND EVERYTHING MARVELLOUS OUT THERE IN THE WARM LANDS IF THERE HAD ONLY BEEN NO SUN
NOW LISTEN AND LOOK AT THE BEAUTIFUL ELDERBUSH
I SHALL MASTER IT SAYS HE
SHE MUST LEARN TO READ AND SEW
AND THEN WENT INTO A CORNER WHERE STRAW AND CARPETS WERE LYING
AND THEN IT WAS PUT TO RIGHTS
BUT THE WHOLE NOW PASSES BEFORE ME AGAIN IN THOUGHT AND EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE LIVED TO SEE
YES YES
IT WAS THE ONLY PIECE SHE KNEW
FIFTH STORY
THEY GAVE OUT THAT THEY KNEW HOW TO WEAVE STUFFS OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND ELABORATE PATTERNS THE CLOTHES MANUFACTURED FROM WHICH SHOULD HAVE THE WONDERFUL PROPERTY OF REMAINING INVISIBLE TO EVERYONE WHO WAS UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE HE HELD OR WHO WAS EXTRAORDINARILY SIMPLE IN CHARACTER
THOUGH NOBODY COULD IMAGINE HOW IT HAD HAPPENED FOR IT WAS QUITE DRY WEATHER
CAN IT BE THAT I AM UNFIT FOR MY OFFICE
THEY ONLY KNOW THEIR OWN OLD RHYMES AND CAN TELL ME NOTHING AND SHE TUCKED UP HER FROCK TO ENABLE HER TO RUN QUICKER
I THANK YOU FOR THE PEWTER SOLDIER MY LITTLE FRIEND SAID THE OLD MAN
NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
THE MEANING OF THIS COUNCILLORSHIP QUERY REMAINED OF COURSE A RIDDLE TO HER YET SHE HANDED HIM THE PAPER WITHOUT REPLYING
THEN I'D PUT HER ON THE STOVE AND SHE'D MELT AND THEN HIS GRANDMOTHER PATTED HIS HEAD AND TOLD HIM OTHER STORIES
THE FACT WAS HE HAD BEEN JUST BROUGHT OUT OF THE FIELDS AND PUT IN A PASTEBOARD HOUSE THREE STORIES HIGH ALL MADE OF COURT-CARDS WITH THE COLORED SIDE INWARDS
HOW INTERESTING YES BUT KEEP MY SECRET FOR I AM AN EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER THE SWINEHERD--THAT IS TO SAY--THE PRINCE FOR NO ONE KNEW THAT HE WAS OTHER THAN AN ILL-FAVORED SWINEHERD LET NOT A DAY PASS WITHOUT WORKING AT SOMETHING
BUT WHEN THEY SPOKE OF DRESS AND GRANDEUR AND BEAUTY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
SHE KNOWS HER GRANDMOTHER
OH YES
BE THAT AS IT MAY IT DID COMPREHEND IT
ALL EXCEPT THREE
AND YET YOU ARE THE BETTER OFF
THE OTHER HOWEVER RETAINED SUFFICIENT PRESENCE OF MIND TO WHISPER TO HIM TIS A BET AND I HAVE WON IT BUT THE FIRST THING HE DID AS SOON AS HE GOT HOME WAS TO HAVE A LARGE BLISTER PUT ON HIS CHEST AND BACK TO DRAW OUT HIS MADNESS
HOW UNFORTUNATE I AM AND THE SWINEHERD WENT BEHIND A TREE WASHED THE BLACK AND BROWN COLOR FROM HIS FACE THREW OFF HIS DIRTY CLOTHES AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS PRINCELY ROBES
SHE WAS TOO DRESSED VERY NICELY
WILT THOU HAVE THY CHILD AGAIN OR SHALL I GO WITH IT THERE WHERE THOU DOST NOT KNOW THEN THE MOTHER WRUNG HER HANDS FELL ON HER KNEES AND PRAYED TO OUR LORD
WERE YOU NEVER IN THE LARDER WHERE CHEESES LIE ON THE SHELVES AND HAMS HANG FROM ABOVE
THERE IT IS CRIED SHE AND STRETCHED HER HANDS OUT OVER A LITTLE BLUE CROCUS THAT HUNG QUITE SICKLY ON ONE SIDE
NEITHER WAS IT OPEN NOR LOW ENOUGH THAT SHE COULD WADE THROUGH IT
THERE WAS ALSO A WIDOW WHO BECAME GLOWING HOT BUT I LEFT HER STANDING TILL SHE GOT BLACK AGAIN
BUT SUCH A FLIGHT IS LIKE THE TRAVELLING OF A SLOTH IN COMPARISON WITH THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH LIGHT MOVES
BUT HOW ARE WE TO MANAGE IT
YES CAN'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE VERY LITTLE SAID THE OLD SEAMAN AND RAN AND PLAYED ABOUT
FOR THE MOMENT HE EXPRESSED THE WISH HIS HEAD WAS FREE
HOW WELL SHE GETS THROUGH THE WORLD BAREFOOTED
THERE STOOD A LITTLE BOY QUITE NAKED AND THE WATER RAN DOWN FROM HIS LONG GOLDEN HAIR
THE LOAVES WERE CONSUMED AND THE HAM TOO
THE LAPLAND WOMAN AND THE FINLAND WOMAN SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED BEFORE A LITTLE HOUSE WHICH LOOKED VERY MISERABLE
EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING AGREEABLE TO SAY TO YOU AND YOU ARE ALWAYS YOUR OWN MASTER
THE WHOLE STORY IS NOTHING BUT SILLY STUPID NONSENSE VI
THE COUNCILLOR BOLDLY DECLARED THE TIME OF KING HANS TO BE THE NOBLEST AND THE MOST HAPPY PERIOD A.D
JUST SUCH ANOTHER LARGE BLOOMING ELDER TREE STANDS NEAR THE NEW BOOTHS
AND SHE FORGOT TO SING HER PSALM AND SHE FORGOT TO PRAY OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN NOW ALL THE PEOPLE WENT OUT OF CHURCH AND THE OLD LADY GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE
AND CHANGED IT HAD SURE ENOUGH
AND IF THE BARK OF ONE OF THE TREES WAS CRACKED THERE GRASS AND LONG CREEPING PLANTS GREW IN THE CREVICES
WHEN THE PATROL CAME UP ALL HIS COMRADES WHO COMPREHENDED NOTHING OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR WERE SEIZED WITH A DREADFUL FRIGHT FOR DEAD HE WAS AND HE REMAINED SO
THE FLIES ALIGHTED UPON THEM IN LARGE DISGUSTING SWARMS
THE BUBBLE BURSTS
AND AS HE WENT HIS BREAST WAS FILLED MORE AND MORE WITH THE FOREST SOLITUDE
IT WAS AS IF THEIR INFANT SOULS WERE NOW TO FLY ALL AT ONCE INTO PERSONS WITH MORE UNDERSTANDING
THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE INFORMED OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE PEOPLE TALKED A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT AND IN THE MORNING THE BODY WAS CARRIED TO THE HOSPITAL
IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO BEWARE THAT WE MAY NOT ACT IN A SIMILAR MANNER FOR WE CAN NEVER KNOW IF WE MAY NOT IN THE COURSE OF TIME ALSO COME INTO THE RAG CHEST AND BE MADE INTO WHITE PAPER AND THEN HAVE OUR WHOLE LIFE'S HISTORY PRINTED ON IT EVEN THE MOST SECRET AND BE OBLIGED TO RUN ABOUT AND TELL IT OURSELVES JUST LIKE THIS COLLAR
SHE THEN LAID TWENTY MATTRESSES ONE UPON ANOTHER OVER THE THREE PEAS AND PUT TWENTY FEATHER BEDS OVER THE MATTRESSES
FAREWELL CRIED PRINCE AND PRINCESS
I HAVE A BOOTJACK AND A HAIR-COMB BUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE FOR IT WAS HIS MASTER WHO HAD THEM
WHAT DID THE SNOWDROPS SAY
STRANGERS ARRIVED EVERY DAY AT THE COURT
I MUST AND WILL FIND THE BELL SAID HE EVEN IF I AM OBLIGED TO GO TO THE END OF THE WORLD THE UGLY APES SAT UPON THE TREES AND GRINNED
A FINE EXTERIOR IS WHAT PEOPLE LOOK AT NOW-A-DAYS THE FLEA THEN WENT INTO FOREIGN SERVICE WHERE IT IS SAID HE WAS KILLED
YOU SEE THAT IT IS A FEELING
YET SHE LIVED
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE IT BUT THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING MORE IN THE WORLD WHICH WAS CALLED THE MANOR-HOUSE AND THAT THERE THEY WERE BOILED AND THEN THEY BECAME BLACK AND WERE THEN PLACED ON A SILVER DISH
THERE IT IS TO BE HOPED I SHALL FIND SOME COACHES
I WANT SOME ONE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PIGS FOR WE HAVE A GREAT MANY OF THEM SO THE PRINCE WAS APPOINTED IMPERIAL SWINEHERD HE HAD A DIRTY LITTLE ROOM CLOSE BY THE PIGSTY
THERE HE IS AGAIN THEY WOULD CRY
BY THE MAGIC POWER OF THE SHOES HE WAS CARRIED BACK TO THE TIMES OF KING HANS
THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN THE FAMILY WAS GOING TO CHURCH THEY ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD NOT GO WITH THEM
HAND IN HAND THEY WENT OUT OF THE BOWER AND THEY WERE STANDING IN THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF THEIR HOME
METAMORPHOSIS OF THE COPYING-CLERK THE WATCHMAN WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
DO YOU HEAR THE COCK CROW TUKEY
GREAT HEAVEN
A LIVELY TOWN THAT HAS STEAM-BOATS AND STAGECOACHES
YOU WILL GET ON IN THE WORLD
THE AIR THEY SAID MUST CERTAINLY BE TOO DENSE TO ALLOW ANY RATIONAL DWELLER IN THE MOON THE NECESSARY FREE RESPIRATION
I HAVE SHED PEWTER TEARS
THE SHOES OF FORTUNE HAD PLACED HIM IN THE MOST DREADFUL SITUATION
I FANCIED THAT I WAS THE LIEUTENANT OVER THERE
TILL THY SKIN SHRIVELS UP AND THOU ART A SKELETON
I SHALL MAKE A TOUR THIS SUMMER
BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO
IN THE HURRY THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SHUT YOUR CAGE AND THE UPPER WINDOW IS OPEN
BUT REALLY IT IS TERRIBLE WHAT AN EFFECT THAT ONE GLASS OF PUNCH MUST HAVE HAD ON ME TWO MINUTES LATER HE WAS SITTING IN A HACKNEY-COACH AND DRIVING TO FREDERICKSHAFEN
I MUST DO SOMETHING IN TIME
I'LL PUT ON MY RED SHOES SAID SHE ONE MORNING
AND THEY BOUGHT THE STUPID BIRD
AND THE ORGAN PEALED SO SOLEMNLY
HE CREEPS SO CAREFULLY
SO NOW HE GOT THE PLACE OF UNIVERSAL BELL-RINGER AND WROTE YEARLY A SHORT TREATISE ON THE OWL
THE STORY OF A MOTHER A MOTHER SAT THERE WITH HER LITTLE CHILD
IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE RAVEN LANGUAGE I CAN TELL YOU BETTER NO I HAVE NOT LEARNT IT SAID GERDA
NO APPLEBLOSSOM CARRIED AWAY BY THE WIND IS MORE BUOYANT
HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE BRIDGE
I MET MANY SHIPS AS I WAS FLYING HITHER FROM EGYPT
I CANNOT HELP THINKING OF THE DEAD MAIDENS
BUT HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT FOR SHE HAD KISSED AWAY ALL FEELING OF COLD FROM HIS BODY AND HIS HEART WAS A LUMP OF ICE
IT WAS THE MOST CHARMING OF ALL BEINGS IT WAS POESY
IMMEDIATELY THE INNER MAN OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE DISPLAYED BEFORE HIM LIKE A GAME OF CARDS IN WHICH HE UNERRINGLY MIGHT READ WHAT THE FUTURE OF EVERY PERSON PRESENTED WAS TO BE
IT WAS A SEAMAN QUITE A LITTLE PERSONAGE SO LITTLE AS IF HE WERE A MIDSHIPMAN
IT BURNED BRIGHTLY AND WHERE THE LIGHT FELL ON THE WALL THERE THE WALL BECAME TRANSPARENT LIKE A VEIL SO THAT SHE COULD SEE INTO THE ROOM
MY INTENDED HAS TOLD ME SO MUCH GOOD OF YOU MY DEAR YOUNG LADY SAID THE TAME RAVEN
AND THEN ALL WERE PURE GEMS
AND THAT NOW ONLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY LOOKED
AND BESIDES IT WAS SO VERY DIRTY OUT-OF-DOORS THEY WERE JUST THE THING FOR HIM HE THOUGHT
LITTLE TUK LOOKED AND ALL WAS RED AND GREEN BEFORE HIS EYES
AT THE PLAY HE SITS IN THE GREAT CHANDELIER AND BURNS IN BRIGHT FLAMES SO THAT PEOPLE THINK IT IS REALLY A FLAME BUT THEY SOON DISCOVER IT IS SOMETHING ELSE
PRAY DO YES IF A FAIRY TALE WOULD COME OF ITS OWN ACCORD
IT WAS ON THE THIRD DAY WHEN A LITTLE PERSONAGE WITHOUT HORSE OR EQUIPAGE CAME MARCHING RIGHT BOLDLY UP TO THE PALACE
YES I HAVE SEEN HER--A SINGLE SHORT MOMENT BUT SLEEP CAME INTO MY EYES
A PRETTY NUMEROUS COMPANY CONSISTING OF SEAMEN COPENHAGEN BURGHERS AND A FEW SCHOLARS SAT HERE IN DEEP CONVERSE OVER THEIR PEWTER CANS AND GAVE LITTLE HEED TO THE PERSON WHO ENTERED
OH HOW PRETTILY IT IS MADE SAID ALL THE COURT LADIES
WITH OTHER TOPICS HE WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE
HOW HER SILKEN ROBE IS RUSTLING
IT IS SAID HE SPOKE AS WELL AS I SPEAK WHEN I TALK RAVEN LANGUAGE
I WILL JUST GIVE THEM A COATING OF WHITE FOR THAT IS AS IT OUGHT TO BE
AT THAT TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MY NATURE
WELL THEN GO
TRATERATRA!"--AND THEN THE DOOR OPENED
BUT DOES HE DO IT
THOU CANST NOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST ME SAID DEATH
FOR SO MUCH I MUST TELL YOU SUCH A LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE WILL NEVER GET PERMISSION TO ENTER OH YES I SHALL SAID GERDA
YOU WILL HAVE A FARM-YARD SO LARGE OH
BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP-HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
IN THE KINGDOM WHERE WE NOW ARE THERE LIVES A PRINCESS WHO IS EXTRAORDINARILY CLEVER
BUT THEY CARED FOR EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS IF THEY WERE
WHEN ONE HAS DRUNK TWO GOOD CUPFULS OF ELDER-FLOWER TEA TIS LIKELY ENOUGH ONE GOES INTO WARM CLIMATES
BUT DO NOT CRY YOU SHALL COME IN STILL
THE HEAT OPPRESSIVE TO SUFFOCATION--THE GNATS HUMMED AND STUNG UNCEASINGLY--THE MISERABILI WITHOUT WHINED AND MOANED IN THEIR SLEEP
NOBODY WAS AT HOME EXCEPT AN OLD LAPLAND WOMAN WHO WAS DRESSING FISH BY THE LIGHT OF AN OIL LAMP
THE THIRD SAID THAT HE NEVER WENT TO A STRANGE PLACE IF HIS PARENTS WERE NOT WITH HIM--THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD BOY HITHERTO AND WOULD STILL BE SO NOW THAT HE WAS CONFIRMED AND THAT ONE OUGHT NOT TO LAUGH AT HIM FOR IT
TO TRAVEL EXCLAIMED HE OVERCOME BY MOST PAINFUL AND PASSIONATE REMEMBRANCES
THE FLOWERS SHONE NO LONGER BUT THERE THEY STOOD FRESH AND BLOOMING AS EVER
GO ON GO ON--THOU WERT ON THE BALCONY AND WENT THROUGH THE DOORWAY AND THEN THEN I WAS IN THE ANTECHAMBER SAID THE SHADOW
SHE BENDS OVER THE RAILING AND LOOKS OUT UPON THE ROSE
RATHER LET ME GO TO THE WARS AND LOSE ARMS AND LEGS
IT WAS THE SNOW QUEEN
THE SUN SHONE THE GREEN LEAVES APPEARED THE SWALLOWS BUILT THEIR NESTS THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN AGAIN SAT IN THEIR PRETTY GARDEN HIGH UP ON THE LEADS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
THE DOORS WERE FASTENED WITH A LOOP OF STRING
AND HAPPY DO I PRIZE THAT CREATURE IN WHICH IT IS INNATE
REMEMBER THAT YOU OWE EVERYTHING TO ME SO THE LADIES WERE OBLIGED TO GO TO HIM AGAIN
BUT THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO AND IT IS ALL PAST NOW
OH GO ON
TO SIT AT ONE'S EASE AND POETISE--THAT IS A PLEASURE
AND I THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU COME OVER TO ME THANKEE
NOW I HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR THE RED SHOES SAID SHE
AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN LOOKED VERY SERIOUS BUT SHE NODDED HER HEAD AND SAID THAT'S NO MATTER--THAT'S NO MATTER
DID SWEET CHILDREN PLAY THERE AND RELATE THEIR DREAMS I TELL YOU I WAS THERE AND YOU CAN CONCEIVE THAT I SAW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO BE SEEN
THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS
HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO
HERE IS THE MANTLE
I WILL CLIMB UP YONDER ROCK AND HE SEIZED HOLD OF THE CREEPING-PLANTS AND THE ROOTS OF TREES--CLIMBED UP THE MOIST STONES WHERE THE WATER-SNAKES WERE WRITHING AND THE TOADS WERE CROAKING--AND HE GAINED THE SUMMIT BEFORE THE SUN HAD QUITE GONE DOWN
YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE WHO SAID THAT THE BELL WAS TOO SMALL AND TOO FINE TO BE HEARD AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE AND BESIDES IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT TONES TO THOSE THAT COULD MOVE A HUMAN HEART IN SUCH A MANNER
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
BUT NO ONE EXCEPT THE PEWTER SOLDIER SAW THAT IT WAS A PIECE OF THE HOG'S-LEATHER HANGINGS
MY BLOOD BOILS IN MY VEINS AND MY HEAD IS BURNING LIKE A COAL AND HE NOW REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT EVENT OF THE EVENING BEFORE HOW HIS HEAD HAD GOT JAMMED IN BETWEEN THE IRON RAILINGS OF THE HOSPITAL
THAT HE KNEW THE NUMBER OF SQUARE MILES THERE WERE IN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HOW MANY INHABITANTS THEY CONTAINED
BE A GOOD BOY TUKEY AND RUN ACROSS AND HELP THE OLD WOMAN WON'T YOU SO TUK RAN OVER QUICKLY AND HELPED HER
BUT HE HAD THE FINEST FALSE COLLARS IN THE WORLD
AND THEN NIGHT SAID GO TO THE RIGHT INTO THE DARK PINE FOREST
NEVER BEFORE HE THOUGHT HAD HE BEEN IN SUCH A COARSE AND IGNORANT COMPANY
HE COULD RECKON FRACTIONS IN HIS HEAD
WHAT CAN BE THE REASON FOR SUCH A CROWD CLOSE BY THE PIGSTY SAID THE EMPEROR WHO HAPPENED JUST THEN TO STEP OUT ON THE BALCONY
HE SAT BESIDE GERDA FOR HE COULD NOT BEAR RIDING BACKWARDS
BUT I KNOW FOR A CERTAINTY THAT IF TO-MORROW A DIM REMEMBRANCE OF IT SHOULD SWIM BEFORE MY MIND IT WILL THEN SEEM NOTHING BUT STUPID NONSENSE AS I HAVE OFTEN EXPERIENCED ALREADY--ESPECIALLY BEFORE I ENLISTED UNDER THE BANNER OF THE POLICE FOR THAT DISPELS LIKE A WHIRLWIND ALL THE VISIONS OF AN UNFETTERED IMAGINATION
AND IT WAS THEN--THE CLOCK IN THE CHURCH-TOWER WAS JUST STRIKING FIVE--THAT KAY SAID OH
LET NO ONE DEEM HIMSELF HAPPY BEFORE HIS END WERE THE WORDS OF SOLON
MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER SIGHED GERDA
THOU SHALT HAVE WINE AND ROASTED APPLES FOR THOU ART VERILY A CHARMING CHILD AND THE BOY WAS SO REALLY
COME LET US BE MEN SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY IMITATING THE CHATTER OF THE PARROT AND AT THE SAME MOMENT HE WAS AGAIN A COPYING-CLERK
IN A POLICE-OFFICE CONSEQUENTLY WE FIND COPYING-CLERKS AMONG MANY OTHER SCRIBES OF VARIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF WHICH IT SEEMS OUR HERO WAS ONE
AND THAT WAS DISHONORABLE
IT HAS HURT ME SO MUCH NOW IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE LADY MUST BE A REAL PRINCESS SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO FEEL THE THREE LITTLE PEAS THROUGH THE TWENTY MATTRESSES AND TWENTY FEATHER BEDS
THE SHINING GLOW-WORMS FLEW AROUND LIKE LITTLE FLOATING LIGHTS
SHE THEN KNEW IT BY HEART
ALL THE DREAMS FLEW IN AGAIN AND THEY NOW LOOKED LIKE THE ANGELS
HE WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY AND WILL ASSUREDLY BLESS THE MOMENT WHEN HE FEELS THAT HE HAS FREED HIMSELF FROM THE FATAL SHOES STUPID NONSENSE SAID THE OTHER ANGRILY
BUT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT HE IS SO PROUD OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF FOR A MAN THAT WHEN HE IS TO BE IN A PROPER HUMOR--AND HE MUST BE SO TO ANSWER WELL--HE MUST BE TREATED QUITE LIKE A MAN OH
YES HE IS HAPPY ENOUGH THAT'S SURE
ON HIM WHOSE EYES BURN HOTTER THAN THE FLAMES--ON HIM THE FIRE OF WHOSE EYES PIERCES HER HEART MORE THAN THE FLAMES WHICH SOON WILL BURN HER BODY TO ASHES
THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT
YET WE MAY BOLDLY ASSERT THAT THE SOUL IS SHREWDEST WHEN IT SHAKES OFF EVERY FETTER AND EVERY SORT OF LEADING-STRING--THE BODY ONLY MAKES IT STUPID
SO THEN THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
SHE BENT BACK ONE OF THE RED LEAVES AND SAW A BROWN NECK
ALL THE OTHER HOUSES IN THE STREET WERE SO NEW AND SO NEAT WITH LARGE WINDOW PANES AND SMOOTH WALLS ONE COULD EASILY SEE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OLD HOUSE
AT A HUNDRED HUMAN PACES FROM HERE THERE SITS A LITTLE SNAIL IN HER HOUSE ON A GOOSEBERRY BUSH
IT TOOK ROOT PUT FORTH GREEN SHOOTS AND GREW UP TO BE THE LARGE TREE UNDER WHICH WE OLD FOLKS ARE NOW SITTING TO BE SURE SAID HE
THERE IS THE LIEUTENANT NOW WHO MIGHT GO QUIETLY TO BED IF HE CHOSE WHERE NO DOUBT HE COULD STRETCH HIMSELF AT HIS EASE
HE SEATED HIMSELF UNDER IT AND SAID NOW WE ARE IN THE SHADE AND THE TREE CAN LISTEN TOO
HERE AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE IN THE WORLD LONG-HEADED PEOPLE GET THROUGH BEST
SHE HAD AN OLD GREY LINEN APRON HANGING OVER HER HEAD AND BACK
THOU COULD'ST NOT PRIZE THE ROSE AND THE NIGHTINGALE BUT THOU WAST READY TO KISS THE SWINEHERD FOR THE SAKE OF A TRUMPERY PLAYTHING
I REMEMBER SO WELL ONE DAY WHEN THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN IN TORRENTS THE SCAVENGERS WERE BEFORE THE HOUSE WHERE I WAS IN SERVICE AND I HAD COME UP WITH THE DUST AND REMAINED STANDING AT THE DOOR--IT WAS DREADFUL WEATHER--WHEN JUST AS I WAS THERE THE POSTMAN CAME AND GAVE ME A LETTER
THE COUNCILLOR SAW QUITE DISTINCTLY BEFORE HIM A LANTERN BURNING AND BEHIND THIS A LARGE HANDSOME HOUSE
GO IN AND ASK HIM THE PRICE OF THE INSTRUMENT SO ONE OF THE COURT-LADIES MUST RUN IN
HE SURVEYED THE LOOMS ON ALL SIDES BUT COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL BUT THE EMPTY FRAMES
SHE RAN ON AS FAST AS SHE COULD
WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN I SAID THE ANIMAL
EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE--NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN
HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING OH THOUGHT THE TREE
AND THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND KEPT ITSELF SO STILL AND QUIET THAT IT MIGHT HEAR ALL THAT PASSED
CRANKY SOUNDED FROM ALL THE FURNITURE
I WONDER IF I SHALL TAKE ROOT HERE AND WINTER AND SUMMER STAND COVERED WITH ORNAMENTS HE KNEW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER--BUT HE WAS SO IMPATIENT THAT FOR SHEER LONGING HE GOT A PAIN IN HIS BACK AND THIS WITH TREES IS THE SAME THING AS A HEADACHE WITH US
NOW THERE SHE WAS SITTING UNDER THE MOST MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMAS TREE
TEN KISSES FROM THE PRINCESS OR I KEEP THE KITCHEN-POT MYSELF THAT MUST NOT BE EITHER SAID THE PRINCESS
AND WHERE THE ROOF OF THE ONE HOUSE JOINED THAT OF THE OTHER AND THE GUTTER RAN ALONG THE EXTREME END OF IT THERE WAS TO EACH HOUSE A SMALL WINDOW
I SAW YOU ALL OVER THERE AT HOME SO DISTINCTLY AS IF YOU REALLY WERE HERE
SHE MAY HAVE THE OLD LEAP-FROG FOR ALL I CARE
THE CLOTH IS CHARMING SAID HE ALOUD
FOR THERE IS ALWAYS SNOW AND ICE THERE
SHE IS THE LARGEST OF ALL
LIGHT AND AIR CONTEND WITH CHIVALRIC EMULATION FOR THE LOVE OF THE FAIR FLOWER THAT BESTOWED HER CHIEF FAVORS ON THE LATTER
A WINDOW STOOD OPEN
WHAT WAS THAT
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE YOU CAN MAKE ONE IN A MOMENT SAID THE LITTLE BOY
NOW THE SHADOW SHOULD BE CUNNING AND GO INTO THE ROOM LOOK ABOUT AND THEN COME AND TELL ME WHAT IT HAD SEEN
BUT YOU WERE NO LONGER IN THE WARM LANDS
A STOUT STATELY DAME RECEIVED THEM WITH A SMILE
I CAME FROM THE WOOD THIS WINTER
AND OTHERS AGAIN LIKE SMALL FAT BEARS WITH THE HAIR STANDING ON END
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ME
HAVE I LAIN HERE IN THE STREET AND DREAMED
HE WAS NOW TO GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY TO LIE IN HIS GRAVE
THE DOOR OPPOSITE WAS ALSO OPENED LATE IN THE EVENING BUT IT WAS DARK WITHIN AT LEAST IN THE FRONT ROOM
THE WHOLE CHARITY SCHOOL JUST OPPOSITE WOULD BE IN MOTION
THE KING LIKES THE HISTORY OF SIR IFFVEN AND SIR GAUDIAN PARTICULARLY WHICH TREATS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE
BUT JUST AS HE WAS GOING THE OTHERS REMARKED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
BUT NOW YOU MUST TELL ME ALL YOU SAW EVERYTHING SAID THE SHADOW
DO YOU INTEND TO KEEP YOUR KNIFE WHILE YOU SLEEP ASKED GERDA
WHAT A TOUR THAT LETTER HAD MADE
I AM MUCH TOO STOUT GROANED HE ALOUD WHILE FIXED AS IN A VICE
FOR THEY WOULD BY NO MEANS BETRAY ANYTHING LIKE SIMPLICITY OR UNFITNESS FOR THEIR OFFICE
THEY WERE IN THE MIDST OF THE COURT-YARD OF A ROBBER'S CASTLE
A KIND OF PUBLIC-HOUSE
BUT SHE WAS NO EVIL BEING SHE ONLY PRACTISED WITCHCRAFT A LITTLE FOR HER OWN PRIVATE AMUSEMENT AND NOW SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO KEEP LITTLE GERDA
HE THEN IMAGINED HE HAD GOT INTO A NEEDLE-CASE FULL OF POINTED NEEDLES OF EVERY SIZE
ONE OF THEM HAD TO GO HOME TO TRY ON A BALL-DRESS
I HAVE TWO PEWTER SOLDIERS--THIS IS ONE OF THEM AND HE SHALL HAVE IT FOR I KNOW HE IS SO VERY VERY LONELY AND THE OLD ERRAND MAN LOOKED QUITE PLEASED NODDED AND TOOK THE PEWTER SOLDIER OVER TO THE OLD HOUSE
THE GATE WAS FORMED OF CUTTING WINDS
AND SHE TAPPED WITH HER FINGERS AT THE WINDOW AND SAID COME OUT
MERCIFUL GOD WHERE AM I EXCLAIMED HE IN AGONY
DO YOU KNOW WHERE LAPLAND LIES SHE ASKED OF THE REINDEER
TELL ME IF YOU STILL SING ON SUNDAYS
AH THAT IS SUPERBE SAID THE PRINCESS WHEN SHE PASSED BY
IF THE EVENING WERE BUT COME
I HAVE NOT GOT MY BOOTS
AND AT LAST IT WAS LIKE A YOUNG LADY DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS
AND YET THE THING WAS NOT VERY MUCH TO MY TASTE AFTER ALL
YOU HAVE HEARD I SUPPOSE ALL SHE SAID
I CAN REMEMBER
BUT AS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OTHERS WHO ARE NOT COPENHAGEN PEOPLE MAY ALSO READ THIS LITTLE WORK WE WILL BEFOREHAND GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF IT
A FINE HOUSE WAS BUILT THERE WITH LARGE WINDOWS AND SMOOTH WHITE WALLS
BUT NO SHADOW CAME AGAIN
IT WAS AN OLD DILAPIDATED MOULDERING DOVECOT
THE EVENING BELL TOLLS FOR THE DEAD YOU MAKE ME QUITE SAD SAID LITTLE GERDA
THEY PRETENDED TO ROLL THE CLOTH OFF THE LOOMS
HOW COLD IT IS HERE SAID HE
CAN THE HEART'S FLAME DIE IN THE FLAME OF THE FUNERAL PILE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AT ALL SAID LITTLE GERDA
YOU ARRIVED AS SOON AS YOUR LETTER AND YOU WERE SO HANDSOME--THAT YOU STILL ARE--AND HAD A LONG YELLOW SILK HANDKERCHIEF ROUND YOUR NECK AND A BRAN NEW HAT ON
LOOKING AT IT RATHER FEARFULLY
WHAT IS THAT SAID SHE AND LOOKED ON ALL SIDES
ON HE WENT AT FULL GALLOP STILL GALLOPING ON AND ON
NOTHING IN THE WORLD CAN BE COMPARED WITH RED SHOES
I MUST GO BACK TO THE NEW MARKET
IN THE EVENING DRAMATIC READINGS WERE TO BE GIVEN AT THE LITTLE THEATRE IN KING STREET
KICKERY-KI
THEY WERE MEANT FOR THE LITTLE GIRL
BUT ALAS THEY WERE ALL WITHERED AND YELLOW
AN OLD GRANDMOTHER WAS SITTING IN THE AIR
I WOULD WILLINGLY GO TO THE MANORHOUSE BE BOILED AND LAID ON A SILVER DISH
I WRITE ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL BUT NO ONE CARES TO HEAR SUCH THINGS
THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT MAY HAPPEN
HOW HAPPY SHOULD I BE WHILE EXPRESSING HIS WISH THE CHARM OF THE SHOES WHICH HE HAD PUT ON BEGAN TO WORK
THE ROSE IN THE VALLEY IS BLOOMING SO SWEET AND ANGELS DESCEND THERE THE CHILDREN TO GREET THERE SAT THE TWO GROWN-UP PERSONS
SHE AND GERDA GOT IN
BUT WHETHER THE SOUND CAME FROM HIS HEAD OR FROM THE HOLLOW TREE THAT NO ONE COULD SAY WITH CERTAINTY
SHE DREW ONE OUT
ON HER BOSOM SHE HAD A REAL ELDERFLOWER AND IN HER YELLOW WAVING HAIR A WREATH OF THE FLOWERS
I DID NOT EXAMINE HIM SO MINUTELY
BY THE EVENING HE HAD MADE A PRETTY LITTLE KITCHEN-POT
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW FAITH IF YOU DESERVE THAT ONE SHOULD RUN FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER FOR YOUR SAKE BUT GERDA PATTED HER CHEEKS AND INQUIRED FOR THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS
AND ALL THE LADIES STOOD ROUND HER WHILST THE KISSING WAS GOING ON
THERE STOOD PARSLEY AND FLOWERING THYME
OTHERS SHIVER IN EVERY LIMB IF ONE RUB A PANE OF GLASS WITH A NAIL
IT WAS A WONDERFUL LIGHT
VAST COLD AND EMPTY WERE THE HALLS OF THE SNOW QUEEN
THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS HAD LARGE WOODEN BOXES THERE IN WHICH VEGETABLES FOR THE KITCHEN WERE PLANTED AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES
ONE OF THE POTS WAS QUITE OVERRUN ON ALL SIDES WITH PINKS THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE GREEN PART
I AM WELL FED AND GET FRIENDLY TREATMENT
FOR IT WAS JUST THE DRESS AND THE BALL WHICH HAD CAUSED HER TO BE CONFIRMED THIS TIME FOR OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COME
KLUK!"--THAT WAS AN OLD HEN WHO CAME CREEPING ALONG AND SHE WAS FROM KJOGE
PETER SCHLEMIHL THE SHADOWLESS MAN
AND THEY WENT TO THE LAPLAND WOMAN WHO MADE SOME NEW CLOTHES FOR THEM AND REPAIRED THEIR SLEDGES
KLUK
KLUK
FOR THEY TOO HAD BELLS ON
BUT AS SOON AS THE CONFUSION OF COLORS WAS SOMEWHAT OVER ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE APPEARED A WOODED SLOPE CLOSE TO THE BAY AND HIGH UP ABOVE STOOD A MAGNIFICENT OLD CHURCH WITH TWO HIGH POINTED TOWERS
I HAVE MUCH ON MY CONSCIENCE I WANT TO BECOME WHITE PAPER AND IT BECAME SO ALL THE RAGS WERE TURNED INTO WHITE PAPER
OTHER PERSONS HAVE A COMMON SHADOW BUT I DO NOT LIKE WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL
WHAT SPLENDID VISTAS WERE THEN OPENED TO MY VIEW
IT MOVES THE DOG FALLS DOWN BARKS AND IS ANGRY
BUT THEREIN WAS JUST THE VERY BEST OF IT FOR ONE COULD THUS SEE THAT SHE WAS OF THE SAME SPECIES
ALL PASSED SO QUICKLY THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON AROUND HIM THE TREE QUITE FORGOT TO LOOK TO HIMSELF
AND LITTLE GERDA RAN OFF BAREFOOTED INTO THE WIDE WORLD
WHICH TREATS OF A MIRROR AND OF THE SPLINTERS NOW THEN LET US BEGIN
THEREFORE TO BOUND UP TO HER IS THE HIGHEST JUMP THAT CAN BE MADE
I HAVE HAD SUCH AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF SWEETHEARTS SAID THE COLLAR
THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT
AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE TURNED ROUND TO KAY AND NODDED TO HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER JUST AS IF THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO
THE PART OF THE BODY MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ON SUCH OCCASIONS WAS NO DOUBT THE HEAD
HE HAD NOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIS LITTLE SISTER AUGUSTA WHO WAS MUCH YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF AND HE WAS BESIDES TO LEARN HIS LESSON AT THE SAME TIME
BUT THEN HE REMARKED AGAIN THAT THE TONE PROCEEDED NOT FROM THERE BUT FARTHER OFF FROM OUT THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST
THE FLEA JUMPED SO HIGH THAT NOBODY COULD SEE WHERE HE WENT TO
AND THEN AWAY THEY DROVE OVER THE STUMPS OF FELLED TREES DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOODS
IT IS TO DECEIVE THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THE PRINCESS TOO
WHAT A MAN THAT MUST BE WHO HAS SO WISE A SHADOW THOUGHT SHE
THEIR FROCKS ARE AS WHITE AS SNOW AND LONG GREEN SILK RIBANDS FLUTTER FROM THEIR BONNETS
I DID NOT GO QUITE IN I REMAINED IN THE FOREMOST ROOM IN THE TWILIGHT BUT I STOOD THERE QUITE WELL
I CAN SEE MYSELF--I CAN SEE MYSELF THAT'S NOTHING TO ME SAID LITTLE GERDA
THEN YOU WILL SPEAK WELL AND WISELY LITTLE TUKEY
I COULD NOT BE IN PEACE
AND SHE TOOK THE HANDS OF EACH AND PROMISED THAT IF SHE SHOULD SOME DAY PASS THROUGH THE TOWN WHERE THEY LIVED SHE WOULD COME AND VISIT THEM
YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT
HE HAD EXQUISITE MANNERS AND BOWED TO THE COMPANY ON ALL SIDES
MANY FLOWERS AND TREES HAVE WITHERED THIS NIGHT
THESE MUST INDEED BE SPLENDID CLOTHES THOUGHT THE EMPEROR
HE CERTAINLY LIKED THE OLD HOUSE BEST AND THAT BOTH IN SUNSHINE AND MOONSHINE
SHE WOULD BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS SHE SAID AND WOULD DO EVERYTHING SHE COULD
OH WON'T YOU TAKE ME TO THE PALACE THAT IS VERY EASILY SAID ANSWERED THE RAVEN
BUT THE DEEP SOUND OF THE BELL ROSE LOUDER
I HAVE HEARD THEM CREAKING IN GRANDMAMA'S ROOM YES THEY CREAKED SAID THE RAVEN
I AM FOND OF THEM
BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY-BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING
HOW GOES IT SAID THE SHADOW
HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY WERE
LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY--THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE
FOR THE WORTHY BACHELOR WAS REALLY TOO IGNORANT AND THE SIMPLEST OBSERVATIONS OF THE COUNCILLOR SOUNDED TO HIM TOO DARING AND PHANTASTICAL
THE STRANGER TURNED ROUND AND THE SHADOW ALSO TURNED ROUND
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SO LONG
CHARMING
IT WAS SO CAPITAL
WE KNOW CHIRPED THE SPARROWS
HOW STRANGE THEY LOOK
AND HOW MY COMRADE THE OTHER PEWTER SOLDIER LIVES
NOW THIS WAS PERHAPS FROM ARROGANCE
AFTER ALL THESE ROSES ARE VERY UGLY
FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE
THAT IS THE HIGHEST AIM OF ALL MY WISHES
HEREUPON THE KING SAID THERE IS NOTHING ABOVE MY DAUGHTER
THIS I LEARNED FROM MY TAME SWEETHEART
BUT DON'T STAY AWAY THE STRANGER ROSE AND HIS SHADOW ON THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S BALCONY ROSE ALSO
THE LORDS OF THE BEDCHAMBER WHO WERE TO CARRY HIS MAJESTY'S TRAIN FELT ABOUT ON THE GROUND AS IF THEY WERE LIFTING UP THE ENDS OF THE MANTLE
STOP SAID HE ALL ON A SUDDEN
AUGH SIGHED HE WERE WE ONLY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ALPS THEN WE SHOULD HAVE SUMMER AND I COULD GET MY LETTERS OF CREDIT CASHED
HE DID NOT KNOW IF HE HAD DREAMED OR NOT OR IF HE HAD BEEN LISTENING WHILE SOMEONE TOLD HIM THE STORY
HOWEVER AS TO YOUR SPEECH I MUST SAY MIHI SECUS VIDETUR
THEY BOTH HAD FORGOTTEN THE COLD EMPTY SPLENDOR OF THE SNOW QUEEN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A DREAM
I HAVE HIGH ROADS AND GARDENS AND I HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO A POET WHO WAS WITTY AND AMUSING WHICH ALL POETS ARE NOT
HE RUBBED HIS EYES AND PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES
HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER
UNLESS YE BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN YE CANNOT ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN AND KAY AND GERDA LOOKED IN EACH OTHER'S EYES AND ALL AT ONCE THEY UNDERSTOOD THE OLD HYMN
THE CONFECTIONER OF THE TOWN CAME OUT AND SET UP HIS BOOTH THERE
THIS ONE NEVER FORGETS IT IS LOVELY HERE IN AUTUMN SAID THE LITTLE MAIDEN
I WAS THERE FOR THREE WEEKS AND THAT HAS AS MUCH EFFECT AS IF ONE HAD LIVED THREE THOUSAND YEARS AND READ ALL THAT WAS COMPOSED AND WRITTEN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS LAKE SAT THE SNOW QUEEN WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME
TIS WELL THAT I'M DREAMING SAID THE CLERK OR I REALLY SHOULD GET ANGRY
HER LITTLE HANDS WERE ALMOST NUMBED WITH COLD
THEY TALKED OF THEIR OLD GRANDMOTHER AND OF THE ROSES UPON THE ROOF
FROM HER FATHER SHE WOULD CERTAINLY GET BLOWS AND AT HOME IT WAS COLD TOO FOR ABOVE HER SHE HAD ONLY THE ROOF THROUGH WHICH THE WIND WHISTLED EVEN THOUGH THE LARGEST CRACKS WERE STOPPED UP WITH STRAW AND RAGS
I FOR MY PART KNOW VERY WELL HOW I CAN BRING ABOUT THIS MOVEMENT AND THIS EXCLAMATION
IT WARMED SO DELIGHTFULLY
IT IS A MAHOGANY SPLINTER SAID THE OTHER
THE GREAT WHITE SNAILS WHICH PERSONS OF QUALITY IN FORMER TIMES MADE FRICASSEES OF ATE AND SAID HEM HEM
GO AFTER YOURS PERHAPS YOU MAY KNOW YOUR CHILD'S
IT LAY QUITE UP OVER THE STEPS JUST AS IF THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME--NOR WAS THERE ANY ONE AT HOME--THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO ASKED THE FIR
I THINK HE IS NOT IN HIS RIGHT SENSES SAID THE PRINCESS AND WALKED ON BUT WHEN SHE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE STOPPED AGAIN
THOU SHALT ALWAYS LIVE WITH ME IN THE PALACE DRIVE WITH ME IN MY ROYAL CARRIAGE AND HAVE TEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR
AND THE ROGUES RAISED THEIR ARMS AS IF IN THE ACT OF HOLDING SOMETHING UP SAYING HERE ARE YOUR MAJESTY'S TROUSERS
AND DID KAY GET THE PRINCESS WERE I NOT A RAVEN I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE PRINCESS MYSELF ALTHOUGH I AM PROMISED
OH YES SAID THE PARROT
WAS IT THERE AS IN THE FRESH WOODS
OH POOR ME
WHERE SHALL I FIND DEATH WHO TOOK AWAY MY LITTLE CHILD SAID SHE
YET I BEG YOU EARNESTLY TO LET US PROFIT BY YOUR LEARNING
I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING
PEOPLE LOOKED THITHERWARD AND FELT THEIR MINDS ATTUNED MOST SOLEMNLY
THAT IS VERY OLD SAID THE COUNCILLOR WHOM THIS PIECE OF ANTIQUITY BEGAN TO MAKE CONSIDERABLY MORE CHEERFUL
AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE--IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHO WERE LOOKING OUT
END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN
THE WATCHMEN IN GERMANY HAD FORMERLY AND IN SOME PLACES THEY STILL CARRY WITH THEM ON THEIR ROUNDS AT NIGHT A SORT OF MACE OR CLUB KNOWN IN ANCIENT TIMES BY THE ABOVE DENOMINATION
IS BROKEN NOW THE LADDER OF MY THOUGHTS
KAY MADE ALL SORTS OF FIGURES THE MOST COMPLICATED FOR IT WAS AN ICE-PUZZLE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING
AND SHE TUCKED HIM UP NICELY LEAST HE SHOULD TAKE COLD
IT TOOK EFFECT ON HIM HE BECAME QUITE MEAGRE--EVEN HIS SHADOW SHRUNK IN FOR THE SUN HAD ALSO AN EFFECT ON IT
AT THE SAME MOMENT CAME SOMEONE WHO EMBRACED ME YES
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLD
IF YOU DON'T I SHALL MAKE YOU IN THE MORNING GERDA TOLD HER ALL THAT THE WOOD-PIGEONS HAD SAID
EVERY MOMENT BROUGHT ABOUT SOME NEW CONFUSION AND THREATENED TO BECOME A PERFECT BABEL
WHAT GLORIOUS COLORS AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY POINTED TO THE EMPTY FRAMES
THERE WAS NEITHER LEAF NOR FLOWER ON IT IT WAS ALSO IN THE COLD WINTER SEASON AND ICE-FLAKES HUNG ON THE BRANCHES
WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME QUITE YOUNG TREES WERE CUT DOWN
WE SHALL SOON SEE THAT THOUGHT THE OLD QUEEN-MOTHER
NOW THE LEARNED MAN DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THAT
IN THIS COLD AND DARKNESS THERE WENT ALONG THE STREET A POOR LITTLE GIRL BAREHEADED AND WITH NAKED FEET
JUST AS WE HAVE LITTLE FLAT PIECES OF WOOD TO MAKE GEOMETRICAL FIGURES WITH CALLED THE CHINESE PUZZLE
WHAT ARE YOU MUTTERING ASKED THE PRINCESS
PUT BOTH INTO THEIR OWN KNAPSACKS
I HAD THOUGHT THE HEAD WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE MATTER--OH
HERE KAY AND GERDA TOOK LEAVE OF THE LAPLAND WOMAN
AND THE CLERGYMAN'S WIFE WAS SORRY FOR HER AND TOOK HER INTO SERVICE
BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT
THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER
IT HAD LANDSCAPES ON THE INSIDE OF THE LID AND IT WAS SO HOARSE WHEN THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON IT
I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE'S OLD SHADOW COULD COME AGAIN AS A MAN TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO PAY SAID THE SHADOW
THE TREE TREMBLED SO IN EVERY BOUGH THAT ONE OF THE TAPERS SET FIRE TO THE FOLIAGE
YOU HAVE AIDED ME I THEREFORE WILL NOW HELP YOU
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS IN MY BED BUT I HAD SOMETHING HARD UNDER ME AND AM ALL OVER BLACK AND BLUE
SHE WAS DIMINUTIVE AND DIRTY
AND THERE WERE A HUNDRED PRINCESSES WHO WOULD HAVE ANSWERED YES AND THANK YOU KINDLY WE SHALL SEE WHAT THIS PRINCESS SAID
THAT WAS A HOUSE TO LOOK AT
EVERY DREAM PROCLAIMED THAT ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE VALUABLES WAS LOST
KAY AND GERDA TOOK EACH OTHER'S HAND
THEY ARE THE LADIES OF THE COURT
BUT I HAVE REMAINED HERE--MUST ALWAYS REMAIN HERE SITTING AT MY DESK IN THE OFFICE AND PATIENTLY SEE OTHER PEOPLE FETCH THEIR PASSPORTS TO GO ABROAD
NO DOUBT IT WOULD IN ITS ANXIETY RUN OFF TO THE POLICE AND THEN TO THE HUE AND CRY OFFICE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE FINDER WILL BE HANDSOMELY REWARDED AND AT LAST AWAY TO THE HOSPITAL
THEY FLY FAR AND WIDE IN RAIN AND SUNSHINE
CAN THE SNOW QUEEN COME IN SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD
YOU NAUGHTY CHILD SAID THE MOTHER
AS HE WAS SITTING ONE EVENING IN HIS ROOM A DREADFUL STORM AROSE WITHOUT AND THE RAIN STREAMED DOWN FROM HEAVEN
V
BUT YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE AFFAIR IS OVER NOW
BUT THE POOR MOTHER RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND CRIED ALOUD FOR HER CHILD
MAY I NOT ASK YOUR NAME THAT I SHALL NOT TELL YOU SAID THE GARTER
SO THERE THEY BOTH SAT LIKE A KING AND A QUEEN UNDER THE FRAGRANT TREE THAT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE AN ELDER
THE CARRIAGE WAS LINED INSIDE WITH SUGAR-PLUMS AND IN THE SEATS WERE FRUITS AND GINGERBREAD
HEM BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
AND HERE IS A ROLL FOR YOU
A LARGE WILD APPLE-TREE BENT OVER IT AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING
THUS CAPARISONED THE GOOD MAN WALKED OUT OF THE WELL-LIGHTED ROOMS INTO EAST STREET
BUT WHETHER THEY WERE REAL PRINCESSES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DECIDE FOR NOW ONE THING NOW ANOTHER SEEMED TO HIM NOT QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THE LADIES
THE NEXT MORNING SHE WENT TO PLAY WITH THE FLOWERS IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND THUS PASSED AWAY A DAY
IT WAS THE DAY OF CONFIRMATION
DON'T YOU SEE HOW MEN AND ANIMALS ARE FORCED TO SERVE HER
THE FLAG UNDER WHICH THE OLD SEAMAN IN THE NEW BOOTHS HAD SAILED
HE SLEPT AND YET HE DID NOT SLEEP
WHILE ABOVE HIS HEAD OUR EARTH WAS ROLLING LIKE A LARGE FIERY BALL
NOW THEN THE SPLENDOR WILL BEGIN AGAIN THOUGHT THE FIR
IT IS THE MOST DREADFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE
BUT IT IS JUST SO WITH THE WORLD SAID THE SHADOW AND SO IT WILL BE AND AWAY IT WENT AGAIN
AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DO UNLESS THEY WERE WATERED--AND SOME ONE MUST WATER THEM--THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
FIE SAID HE
THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND FAR WITHIN THE MUSIC SOUNDED SO SOFT AND DELIGHTFUL ONE COULD REALLY MELT AWAY IN SWEET THOUGHTS FROM IT
SOME PERSONS EVEN GOT A SPLINTER IN THEIR HEART AND THEN IT MADE ONE SHUDDER FOR THEIR HEART BECAME LIKE A LUMP OF ICE
THE SNOW QUEEN HAS HER SUMMER-TENT THERE
AND IT WAS AS IF THE CARVED-OUT TRUMPETERS--FOR THERE WERE TRUMPETERS WHO STOOD IN TULIPS CARVED OUT ON THE DOOR--BLEW WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT THEIR CHEEKS APPEARED SO MUCH ROUNDER THAN BEFORE
LAUGHING IS AN INFALLIBLE SIGN OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT
THE EMPEROR HAD THEM BROUGHT INTO A LARGE HALL WHERE THE PRINCESS WAS PLAYING AT VISITING WITH THE LADIES OF THE COURT
BUT FROM THE PALACE THEY GOT NOTHING WHATEVER NOT EVEN A GLASS OF WATER
BUT ON THE CONTRARY IMPLORED THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PRESENT TO PROCURE HIM A HACKNEY-COACH
LET ME SEE HIM SAID THE YOUNG MAN
HOWEVER THEY PUT ALL THAT WAS GIVEN THEM INTO THEIR KNAPSACKS
YOU KNOW YOURSELF THAT IT IS FINE AND THAT I LIKE
THE WHOLE DAY IS SO LONG AND THE EVENINGS ARE STILL LONGER
ONE HALF OF THE COMPANY WAS ALREADY SEATED AT THE CARD-TABLE THE OTHER HALF AWAITED THE RESULT OF THE STEREOTYPE PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION OF THE LADY OF THE HOUSE
SHE IS AS GOOD AS A FATTED LAMB
AND AS TO THE SMELL THEREIN--NO--THAT WAS BEYOND DESCRIPTION
SUCH WAS MY WISH YEA SUCH WHEN HARDLY THREE FEET HIGH I LONGED FOR MUCH
YES THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY
HE HIMSELF SAT IN THE CARRIAGE OF THE SNOW QUEEN WHO PASSED HERE DOWN JUST OVER THE WOOD AS WE LAY IN OUR NEST
OUR SON SHALL NOT GO INTO AN ANT-HILL
I AM A BACHELOR IN THEOLOGIA ANSWERED THE GENTLEMAN WITH A STIFF REVERENCE
AND AT LAST LITTLE GERDA DID NOT THINK SO ANY LONGER EITHER
SHE EVEN GAVE HER A SMALL CUSHION TO SIT ON
IT WAS REALLY SPLENDID--BEYOND DESCRIPTION SPLENDID
WHAT WITH THE RAIN AND THE WIND SHE WAS IN A SAD CONDITION
SHOES AND A MUFF WERE GIVEN HER
BUT THEY DID NOT OBSERVE IT
THE EMPEROR SHARED IN THE GENERAL SATISFACTION
THAT HOWEVER WAS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY FOR ONE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING
I THINK I KNOW
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT STRANGE THINGS MEN--NO WHAT STRANGE THINGS SELENITES SOMETIMES TAKE INTO THEIR HEADS
BUT DOUBLY CAREFUL MUST ONE BE WHEN WE HAVE THE SHOES OF FORTUNE ON OUR FEET
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR ASKED HE
ONLY IN THAT SINGLE HOUSE WHICH STOOD OPPOSITE THAT IN WHICH THE LEARNED FOREIGNER LIVED IT WAS QUITE STILL
FROM THE ROOF INSIDE THE CARRIAGE UMBRELLAS WALKING-STICKS HATS AND SUNDRY OTHER ARTICLES WERE DEPENDING AND HINDERED THE VIEW WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY IMPOSING
IN THIS MIRROR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES LOOKED LIKE BOILED SPINACH AND THE BEST PERSONS WERE TURNED INTO FRIGHTS OR APPEARED TO STAND ON THEIR HEADS
AT ONCE SHE SEIZED HOLD OF TWO BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS CLOSE BY WITH EACH HAND AND CRIED OUT TO DEATH I WILL TEAR ALL THY FLOWERS OFF FOR I AM IN DESPAIR TOUCH THEM NOT SAID DEATH
YOU CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING ME SO WELL OFF
THE MORN NOW CAME
IN WINTER THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE
BUT THE MUFF I SHALL KEEP FOR MYSELF FOR IT IS SO VERY PRETTY
AND THEY STOOD IN A BEECH-WOOD THAT HAD JUST PUT ON ITS FIRST GREEN WHERE THE WOODROOF AT THEIR FEET SENT FORTH ITS FRAGRANCE AND THE PALE-RED ANEMONY LOOKED SO PRETTY AMONG THE VERDURE
I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE THAT TO-DAY IS MY BIRTHDAY
IT WAS STILL LARGER AND MORE DECORATED THAN THE ONE WHICH SHE HAD SEEN THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR IN THE RICH MERCHANT'S HOUSE
HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SWITZERLAND BUT PACKED UP WITH EIGHT OTHER PASSENGERS IN THE INSIDE OF AN ETERNALLY-CREAKING DILIGENCE
FOR SHE HAS READ ALL THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND HAS FORGOTTEN THEM AGAIN--SO CLEVER IS SHE
HE SAID HEM
WE SHALL TRAVEL AS COMRADES AND SO THEY TRAVELLED
BUT I WAS CIRCUMSPECT I TOOK TIME TO THINK AND THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS DO AND WHAT DIDST THOU THEN SEE ASKED THE LEARNED MAN
DDSA WAS AGAIN HEARD IN THE AIR
THE SHOES WERE PLACED IN A CLOSET AT HOME BUT KAREN COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM
BUT CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT WE ARE FOLKS OF QUALITY IN THE WORLD
NO THAT MUST NOT BE SAID EITHER
HERE IS A PAIR OF LINED GLOVES OF MY MOTHER'S
AND SO THERE HE LAY ON THE UPPERMOST BANK IN THE VAPOR-BATH
OH FAR HAPPIER WERE I COULD I EXCHANGE WITH HIM MY BEING--WITH HIS DESIRES AND WITH HIS HOPES PERFORM THE WEARY PILGRIMAGE OF LIFE
BUT THEN I MUST GO INTO THE DEEP HOLE AH AH
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND HELD ONE ANOTHER BY THE HAND
AND THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER OWN FLOWERS
THE ODOUR OF THE FLOWERS SAYS THEY ARE CORPSES
HE NEVER DREAMED FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF FORTUNE
THEN SHE TOOK OFF HER RED SHOES THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS SHE POSSESSED AND THREW THEM BOTH INTO THE RIVER
AND THAT YOU CAN FIND A STORY IN EVERYTHING YES BUT SUCH TALES AND STORIES ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING
IT IS THE WHITE BEES THAT ARE SWARMING SAID KAY'S OLD GRANDMOTHER
IS LITTLE KAY REALLY DEAD
BUT GERDA THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD NOT THROWN THE SHOES OUT FAR ENOUGH SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES
NOW LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO AMUSE OURSELVES THEY HAD GOT JUST SO FAR AND THE CONVERSATION BEGAN TO CRYSTALLISE AS IT COULD BUT DO WITH THE SCANTY STREAM WHICH THE COMMONPLACE WORLD SUPPLIED
FOR ON NO ACCOUNT WOULD HE SAY THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT TWO OF THE OFFICERS OF HIS COURT HAD PRAISED SO MUCH
WE HAVE PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOWS IN THE TOWN BELOW
WAS IT THERE AS IN A HOLY CHURCH
AND THE THORN-BUSH TOLD HER THE WAY SHE SHOULD GO
AND NUMEROUS AS THEY WERE IT STILL SEEMED TO GERDA THAT ONE WAS WANTING THOUGH SHE DID NOT KNOW WHICH
IN THE PARK HE MET A FRIEND ONE OF OUR YOUNG POETS WHO TOLD HIM THAT THE FOLLOWING DAY HE SHOULD SET OUT ON HIS LONG-INTENDED TOUR
WITHOUT WAS HEARD THE HORN OF A POST-BOY
GERDA WAS SO CHILLED THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
BESIDES THEY ARE READ AT COURT
AND KAREN STRETCHED OUT HER LITTLE FOOT
THAT WAS AN OLD TURN-UP BEDSTEAD
THIS IS IN FACT A BASE WORLD
THE EMPEROR NOW SENT ANOTHER OFFICER OF HIS COURT TO SEE HOW THE MEN WERE GETTING ON AND TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE CLOTH WOULD SOON BE READY
IT IS LOVELY HERE IN SPRING SAID THE YOUNG MAIDEN
I LIE ON THE SEA SAID CORSOR
THE LARGE SLEDGE STOPPED AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE ROSE UP
WHEN SUDDENLY BOTH FOLDING-DOORS OPENED AND A TROOP OF CHILDREN RUSHED IN AS IF THEY WOULD UPSET THE TREE
IT WOULD HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY IF I WERE TO BEGIN HERE AS I INTENDED TO DO WITH
SHE SHALL SLEEP IN MY BED AND THEN SHE GAVE HER MOTHER ANOTHER BITE SO THAT SHE JUMPED AND RAN ROUND WITH THE PAIN
SHE FELT SUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE KNEW
WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE RETURNED HOME THEY SAID IT HAD BEEN VERY ROMANTIC AND THAT IT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF THING TO A PIC-NIC OR TEA-PARTY
AND IN THE BARN OLD WOMEN MAIDENS AND CHILDREN WERE SITTING PICKING HOPS INTO A LARGE CASK
BUT IT MUST BE FAR FAR AWAY
BUT THIS WAS ALL DONE OUT OF PURE LOVE
HOW PLUMP HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS
I FLEW ABOUT BENEATH THE GREEN PALMS AND THE BLOSSOMING ALMOND-TREES SANG THE CANARY
IN OTHER RESPECTS THE WHOLE WENT OFF VERY QUIETLY FOR THE OLD FOLKS COULD NOT BEAR NOISE AND MERRIMENT
THAT'S THE RABBLE
I HAVE HALF A MIND TO GO BACK AGAIN AND SAY WHAT I SUFFER
I REALLY BELIEVE MY SHADOW BY THE DOOR THERE CAN ANSWER THEM YOUR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS
HEAR ME NOT
SO SHE WENT TO THE LEARNED MAN BY THE DOOR AND SHE SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ABOUT PERSONS OUT OF AND IN THE WORLD AND HE ANSWERED WITH WISDOM AND PRUDENCE
THERE IT IS GLORIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL SAID THE REINDEER
A MAN AS PEOPLE SAID OF TALENT AND FEELING
DOES NOT THE STUFF APPEAR AS BEAUTIFUL TO YOU AS IT DID TO MY LORD THE MINISTER ASKED THE IMPOSTORS OF THE EMPEROR'S SECOND AMBASSADOR
LITTLE TUK SAW ALL HEARD ALL
AND THOU WILT GO TO PRISON AND THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO--FOR THE SENTINELS OBEYED HIM WHOM THEY KNEW THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS TO MARRY
CHILDREN'S HEARTS CAN ALSO BEAT
AND THEY THEN FREEZE IN SO WONDROUS A MANNER THAT THEY LOOK LIKE FLOWERS YES I HAVE SEEN IT SAID BOTH THE CHILDREN
WE ARE PROVIDED WITH A HOUSE FROM OUR BIRTH AND THE BURDOCK FOREST IS PLANTED FOR OUR SAKES
HE FELT AS IT WERE THE FRAGRANCE OF THE DANISH GROVES
HE SAUNTERS UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM BECAUSE PROBABLY HE HAS ENJOYED TOO MANY OF THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD AT HIS DINNER
AND A THOUSAND PICTURES WERE REFLECTED IN THE EYE AND IN THE HEART OF THE BOY
AND IT REACHED INTO THE VERY BED AND PUSHED THE CURTAINS ASIDE
HE FLEW INTO A TREE AND BEAT HIS BLACK WINGS AS LONG AS HE COULD SEE THE CARRIAGE THAT SHONE FROM AFAR LIKE A SUNBEAM
THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN THEY DROVE THROUGH THE DARK WOOD
THE LITTLE GIRL HAD LEARNED A HYMN IN WHICH THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ROSES
THEN THEY SHOUTED THAT THE WHOLE PLACE RE-ECHOED WITH THEIR REJOICING
IT WAS SO PALE THE SMALL EYES HAD CLOSED THEMSELVES AND IT DREW ITS BREATH SO SOFTLY NOW AND THEN WITH A DEEP RESPIRATION AS IF IT SIGHED
THE LITTLE BOY LAY IN HIS BED
AND THAT WAS A SAD AFFAIR WHEN PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR GLASSES TO SEE WELL AND RIGHTLY
IN THE EVENING WHEN LITTLE KAY WAS AT HOME AND HALF UNDRESSED HE CLIMBED UP ON THE CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND PEEPED OUT OF THE LITTLE HOLE
SO HE PUT THEM ON QUICKLY STUCK HIS PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND TOOK BESIDES A FEW UNDER HIS ARM INTENDING TO LOOK THEM THROUGH AT HOME TO MAKE THE NECESSARY NOTES
BUT TO BEGIN
SHE LIGHTED ANOTHER MATCH
THE WHOLE WORLD IS LEAGUED AGAINST ME BUT SUDDENLY IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT STOOP DOWN UNDER THE TABLE AND THEN CREEP UNOBSERVED OUT OF THE DOOR
AND THE REINDEER TOLD HER THE WHOLE OF GERDA'S HISTORY BUT FIRST OF ALL HIS OWN
THE SHADOW WAS MASTER AND THE MASTER WAS THE SHADOW
YES SAID THE EMPEROR AND HE WEPT LIKE A CHILD AT THE REMEMBRANCE
AND THE SNOW QUEEN HAD SAID IF YOU CAN DISCOVER THAT FIGURE YOU SHALL BE YOUR OWN MASTER AND I WILL MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND A PAIR OF NEW SKATES BUT HE COULD NOT FIND IT OUT
MY SWEETHEART KNOWS A LITTLE BACK STAIR THAT LEADS TO THE BEDCHAMBER AND SHE KNOWS WHERE SHE CAN GET THE KEY OF IT AND THEY WENT INTO THE GARDEN IN THE LARGE AVENUE WHERE ONE LEAF WAS FALLING AFTER THE OTHER
BECAUSE IN DOING SO HE WOULD HAVE DECLARED HIMSELF EITHER A SIMPLETON OR UNFIT FOR HIS OFFICE
BUT IT WAS ONLY HEARD FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
INDEED PLEASE YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY SAID HE TO HIS SOVEREIGN WHEN HE RETURNED THE CLOTH WHICH THE WEAVERS ARE PREPARING IS EXTRAORDINARILY MAGNIFICENT THE WHOLE CITY WAS TALKING OF THE SPLENDID CLOTH WHICH THE EMPEROR HAD ORDERED TO BE WOVEN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
AND THEN HE SAT WITH THE POLISHED BOOTS AS HEAVILY AS HE COULD ON THE ARM OF THE LEARNED MAN'S NEW SHADOW WHICH LAY LIKE A POODLE-DOG AT HIS FEET
SHE DIRECTLY OBSERVED THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD JUST COME WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON TO ALL THE OTHERS
BUT SHE DID NOT HEAR THE ANGEL'S REPLY FOR THE SHOES CARRIED HER THROUGH THE GATE INTO THE FIELDS ACROSS ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SHE MUST KEEP EVER DANCING
THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE HAD A SOMETHING FAMILIAR ABOUT IT
I WOULD TRAVEL TO ITALY AND IT WAS A GOOD THING THAT THE POWER OF THE GALOSHES WORKED AS INSTANTANEOUSLY AS LIGHTNING IN A POWDER-MAGAZINE WOULD DO OTHERWISE THE POOR MAN WITH HIS OVERSTRAINED WISHES WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED ABOUT THE WORLD TOO MUCH FOR HIMSELF AS WELL AS FOR US
ALAS!"--SIGHED HE AND WAS AGAIN SILENT
HIS KINGDOM WAS VERY SMALL BUT STILL QUITE LARGE ENOUGH TO MARRY UPON
THERE WAS A WHOLE ROW OF THEM STANDING FROM THE TOWN-GATES TO THE PALACE
I AM A COPYING-CLERK AT THE POLICE-OFFICE
ALL THE FLOWERS SHONE LIKE FLAMES IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE FLOWERS STOOD A SLENDER GRACEFUL MAIDEN--IT WAS AS IF SHE ALSO SHONE
FROM OUT THE HILL-SIDE SPOUTED FOUNTAINS IN THICK STREAMS OF WATER SO THAT THERE WAS A CONTINUAL SPLASHING
AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE
AS THOU DOST KNOW WHO ALL MEN'S HEARTS CANST SEE
LAKE THRACYMENE ILLUMINED BY THE EVENING SUN LAY LIKE FLAMING GOLD BETWEEN THE DARK-BLUE MOUNTAIN-RIDGES
TELL HIM HE SHALL AS ON YESTERDAY HAVE TEN KISSES FROM ME AND MAY TAKE THE REST FROM THE LADIES OF THE COURT OH--BUT WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL SAID THEY
THUS PASSED MANY YEARS AND HE WAS NOW AN OLD MAN AND SAT WITH HIS OLD WIFE UNDER THE BLOOMING TREE
THE BEGINNING OF THE POEM HE PRAISED WITH GREAT GENEROSITY
THAT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT
THE COUNCILLOR SUPPORTED HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND DREW A LONG BREATH AND THOUGHT OVER ALL THE WONDROUS THINGS HE SAW AROUND HIM
IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO LOOK AT THE GENTLEMAN'S GENTLEMAN SO VERY HAUGHTILY DID HE STAND IN THE DOORWAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE SAID LITTLE GERDA
THIS YOU CAN TAKE WITH YOU TO THE FINLAND WOMAN AND SHE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION THAN I CAN WHEN GERDA HAD WARMED HERSELF AND HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THE LAPLAND WOMAN WROTE A FEW WORDS ON A DRIED HABERDINE BEGGED GERDA TO TAKE CARE OF THEM PUT HER ON THE REINDEER BOUND HER FAST AND AWAY SPRANG THE ANIMAL
THEN DEATH BLEW ON HER HANDS AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS COLDER THAN THE COLD WIND AND HER HANDS FELL DOWN POWERLESS
WHAT HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE BISHOP SIGHED THE COUNCILLOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
HE REMARKED THE ROSES AND THE FRESH BEECHES BUT THE ELDER TREE HAD A MORE WONDROUS FRAGRANCE FOR ITS FLOWERS HUNG ON THE BREAST OF THE LITTLE MAIDEN
THE LIGHT BURNT IN THE ROOM BEHIND HIM
THE FIR TREE STOOD QUITE STILL AND ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MEN'S PAINS DOST SEE SUCH VERSES AS THESE PEOPLE WRITE WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE
THEY WERE NOT BROTHER AND SISTER
BUT SURELY NOBODY CAN EXPECT THAT THE SOUL OF THE WATCHMAN SHOULD UNDERSTAND IT
I HAVE EVEN GOT FLESH AND CLOTHES
HE WAS DRIVEN OUT THERE BUT NO ONE FOLLOWED
THE WHOLE DAY LONG I SIT IN THE OFFICE AMID THE DRIEST LAW-PAPERS AND AT NIGHT I FLY IN MY DREAM AS A LARK IN THE GARDENS OF FREDERICKSBURG
REJOICE IN THY OWN FRESH YOUTH BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL
A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE--AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS"--A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
AND THE ARMOR RATTLED AND THE SILKEN GOWNS RUSTLED
THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
THIS IS RATHER TOO BAD THOUGHT HE THAT I MUST SAY YOU AND HE SAY THOU BUT HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH IT
BUT HOW DOES THE SEA LOOK IN REALITY
OH HEAR ME NOT WHEN I PRAY AGAINST THY WILL WHICH IS THE BEST
THERE ON THE FLOOR LAY THE GALOSHES WHICH THE WATCHMAN HAD FORGOTTEN
WHEN SUDDENLY THEY STEP FORTH EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS
HOW WELL CAN SHE RECALL PERSONS TO OUR MIND OF WHOM WE HAVE NOT THOUGHT FOR YEARS
TRAVELLING WOULD BE AGREEABLE ENOUGH SAID HE GROANING IF ONE ONLY HAD NO BODY OR COULD SEND IT TO REST WHILE THE SPIRIT WENT ON ITS PILGRIMAGE UNHINDERED WHITHER THE VOICE WITHIN MIGHT CALL IT
THE GILDING DECAYS BUT HOG'S LEATHER STAYS SAID THE WALLS
AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOOKED AT KAREN'S RED SHOES AND ALL THE PICTURES AND AS KAREN KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR AND RAISED THE CUP TO HER LIPS SHE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE RED SHOES AND THEY SEEMED TO SWIM IN IT
I WILL HAVE TEN KISSES FROM THE PRINCESS SAID THE SWINEHERD
I SHALL GO WILD
WHAT BECAME OF HIM
AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE TUNE SHE STOOD QUITE STILL AND SEEMED PLEASED
YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
HER CLOAK AND CAP WERE OF SNOW
I NEVER DID SEE ANYTHING SO SLENDER AND SO FINE SO SOFT AND SO NEAT
HE COPIED ALL HER WAYS AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM
THE NAUGHTY BOY TO SHOOT THE OLD POET IN THAT WAY
IT WAS THE MOST WRETCHED MISERY DRAGGED FROM AMONG THE FILTHIEST RAGS
THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
HE IS SO FRIGHTENED AT IT AND THE LITTLE GIRL DREW FORTH A LONG KNIFE FROM A CRACK IN THE WALL AND LET IT GLIDE OVER THE REINDEER'S NECK
I LIKE THAT SAID THE PRINCESS
WHAT A LONGING DO I SUFFER
TO-DAY IS POLLY'S BIRTHDAY SAID SHE WITH STUPID SIMPLICITY
WHEN A FRIENDSHIP IS FORMED BETWEEN MEN THEY GENERALLY AFFIRM IT WHEN OCCASION OFFERS EITHER IN PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BY DRINKING TO EACH OTHER AND EXCLAIMING THY HEALTH AT THE SAME TIME STRIKING THEIR GLASSES TOGETHER
THAT GREAT REALM THAT MIGHT IN AN ILL-HUMOR BESTIR ITSELF AND DASH DOWN A HAIL-STORM IN OUR FACES OR FORCE THE BALTIC TO OVERFLOW THE SIDES OF ITS GIGANTIC BASIN
IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF GLASS FROM THE MAGIC MIRROR THAT HAD GOT INTO HIS EYE
I HAVE HAD A VISIT FROM MINE AND YOU MAY BE SURE IT IS NO PLEASANT THING IN THE END
THE THING IS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IT SAID THE NARRATOR
IN THIS MANNER HE ASCENDS GRADUALLY TO THE HIGHEST
THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY
NOISY CREATURE
BUT I SHALL NOT LEAVE THE PLACE FOR IT NOW BEGINS TO BE AMUSING HERE
NOW THE OLD LADY WAS SICK AND IT WAS SAID SHE COULD NOT RECOVER
YES--LISTEN SAID THE RAVEN
BUT SHE WAS FULL OF MYSTERY ABOUT HER ART IN WHICH A CERTAIN PAIR OF MAGIC SPECTACLES DID HER ESSENTIAL SERVICE
WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE OLD MAN OPENING HIS EYES VERY WIDE
COME LET US BE MEN O WARM SPICY LAND OF MY BIRTH SANG THE CANARY BIRD
HA SCREAMED POLLY AND ADDED HIS STEREOTYPE WITTICISM
DO YOU NOT THINK THAT I SHALL SAVE HIM SAID SHE
THEY HAD SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK
AND THEY ALL TOLD HER VERY MANY THINGS BUT NOT ONE KNEW ANYTHING OF KAY
FOR THEY ALL USED TO CHATTER FRENCH EACH ONE WORSE THAN HER NEIGHBOR
BUT PEOPLE GAVE IT AS THEIR OPINION THAT HE THEREFORE THOUGHT THE MORE
THAT ANDERSEN
AND THE FIRST MOVEMENT WHICH HIS HAND MADE DESCRIBED A MAGIC TRIANGLE FROM THE RIGHT POCKET TO THE LEFT AND THEN UP TOWARDS THE BOSOM TO FEEL IF HE HAD THEM ALL SAFE OR NOT
BUT THE REASON OF THAT IS HE HAS A SPLINTER OF GLASS IN HIS EYE AND IN HIS HEART
THERE WAS SUCH A HEAT INSIDE THAT THE FINLAND WOMAN HERSELF WENT ABOUT ALMOST NAKED
WITH SONGS AND HURRAHS THE ICE WAS SAWN ASUNDER THE SHIPS WERE FRESH TARRED AND RIGGED THAT THEY MIGHT SAIL AWAY TO DISTANT LANDS
BUT THERE SITS ALREADY A SPRUCE YOUNG SHOPMAN WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S AMISS IN THE WHOLE SHOP
I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO SAY THOU TO ME BUT I WILL WILLINGLY SAY THOU TO YOU SO IT IS HALF DONE SO THE SHADOW SAID THOU TO ITS FORMER MASTER
BUT THIS THOU SHALT KNOW FROM ME THAT THE ONE FLOWER WAS THY OWN CHILD
MOST OF THEM WERE OF WOOD SLIGHTLY PUT TOGETHER
THE EMPEROR TURNING ROUND FROM SIDE TO SIDE BEFORE THE LOOKING GLASS
HERE TOO ON THE BLACK COFFIN THE SPHYNX GAVE US NO ANSWER TO WHAT HE WHO LAY WITHIN HAD WRITTEN TWO DAYS BEFORE
THE MASTER OF THE MINT STRUCK NEW COIN FOR ME AND THE WOMEN SAID I WAS SO HANDSOME
THEN IN CAME THE OLD MAN WITH THE MOST PLEASED AND HAPPY FACE THE MOST DELICIOUS PRESERVES APPLES AND NUTS AND SO THE LITTLE BOY THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE PEWTER SOLDIER
AND ALL THE PEOPLE STANDING BY AND THOSE AT THE WINDOWS CRIED OUT OH
I INTENDED TO LOOK FOR KAY
HOW DID I GET UP HERE--AND SO BURIED IN SLEEP TOO
THEY WERE VERY LARGE SLIPPERS WHICH HER MOTHER HAD HITHERTO WORN
OUR HEAVIEST GRIEF THE WORLD OFT SEETH NOT OUR SOREST PAIN WE HIDE FROM STRANGER EYES
AND THE LITTLE BROWN FIELD-BIRD MUST WISH HIM JOY MR POLLY UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE IN REPLY BUT SWUNG TO AND FRO WITH DIGNIFIED CONDESCENSION
SO THEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD FLY UP TO THE SKY AND HAVE A JOKE THERE
IF THE SEAMAN LOOSENS ONE KNOT THEN HE HAS A GOOD WIND
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY LITTLE PLAYFELLOW
WERE I BUT LOOSE
ALL THE LADIES OF THE COURT WITH THEIR ATTENDANTS AND ATTENDANTS ATTENDANTS AND ALL THE CAVALIERS WITH THEIR GENTLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN'S GENTLEMEN STOOD ROUND
THE FINEST ANT'S PALACE WITH SEVEN HUNDRED PASSAGES I THANK YOU SAID MOTHER SNAIL
SHE PLANTED IT WITH HER LITTLE HAND AND PRESSED THE EARTH AROUND IT WITH HER FINGERS
HE TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE WORLD IN HOPES OF FINDING SUCH A LADY
THANKEE OR CRANKY
NEAR THE GREEN LAWN PAPA'S WALKING-STICK WAS TIED AND FOR THE LITTLE ONES IT SEEMED TO BE ENDOWED WITH LIFE
AND SPRING CAME AND SUMMER
IT WAS A HUGE DESOLATE PLAIN
HERE WE ARE THE BOAT DRIFTED WITH THE STREAM LITTLE GERDA SAT QUITE STILL WITHOUT SHOES FOR THEY WERE SWIMMING BEHIND THE BOAT BUT SHE COULD NOT REACH THEM BECAUSE THE BOAT WENT MUCH FASTER THAN THEY DID
AN OLD OLD SEAMAN AND HIS OLD OLD WIFE
WHAT'S TO BECOME OF ME GROANED HE
THE OLD HOUSE IN THE STREET UP THERE WAS AN OLD A VERY OLD HOUSE--IT WAS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD FOR THAT MIGHT BE KNOWN BY READING THE GREAT BEAM ON WHICH THE DATE OF THE YEAR WAS CARVED
BUT THE OLD POET SAT WARM AND COMFORTABLE IN HIS CHIMNEY-CORNER WHERE THE FIRE BLAZED AND THE ROASTING APPLE HISSED
THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE
THE HOG'S LEATHER SPOKE AND THE OLD CHAIRS HAD THE GOUT IN THEIR LEGS AND RHEUMATISM IN THEIR BACKS
AND DIRECTLY UNDER THE EAVES WAS A LEADEN SPOUT WITH A DRAGON'S HEAD
THE SWEET CHILDREN'S VOICES SANG AND THE OLD MUSIC-DIRECTORS SANG BUT KAREN ONLY THOUGHT OF HER RED SHOES
I BEGIN TO UNFOLD MYSELF
IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOES STOOD A PAIR OF RED ONES JUST LIKE THOSE THE PRINCESS HAD WORN
THERE WAS ONE INDEED THAT WAS CONSIDERABLY SHORTER
IT IS A SIMPLE DAISY JUST BURSTING OUT OF THE BUD
THERE WOULD BE A MOB A HISSING AND REJOICING AND JEERING TEN TIMES WORSE THAN IN THE ROWS ABOUT THE JEWS SOME YEARS AGO--"OH MY BLOOD IS MOUNTING TO MY BRAIN
I WAS SO HAPPY
PORTRAITS WERE HANGING ON THE WALLS AND NEAR THE WHITE PORCELAIN STOVE STOOD TWO LARGE CHINESE VASES WITH LIONS ON THE COVERS
SIT FIRM WHEN YOU DANCE
PERHAPS THE RIVER WILL CARRY ME TO LITTLE KAY SAID SHE
IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST TIME FOR OVER THERE ONE DAY AND HOUR WAS JUST LIKE ANOTHER
THEY KNOCKED AT THE CHIMNEY OF THE FINLAND WOMAN
HE COULD NOT SAY IT BETTER
FOR HE HAD NOBLE BLOOD AND WAS MOREOVER ACCUSTOMED TO THE SOCIETY OF MAN ALONE
KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN
TOGETHER WITH TULIPS AND HOP-BINDS THERE WERE WHOLE VERSES SPELLED AS IN FORMER TIMES AND OVER EVERY WINDOW WAS A DISTORTED FACE CUT OUT IN THE BEAM
BUT BEFORE SHE COULD DO SO THE BOAT WAS MORE THAN A YARD FROM THE LAND AND WAS GLIDING QUICKLY ONWARD
BUT IN THE CORNER AT THE COLD HOUR OF DAWN SAT THE POOR GIRL WITH ROSY CHEEKS AND WITH A SMILING MOUTH LEANING AGAINST THE WALL--FROZEN TO DEATH ON THE LAST EVENING OF THE OLD YEAR
AT ALL EVENTS HERE ARE SOME PEOPLE UP AND STIRRING
ON THE SHIPS WERE MAGNIFICENT MASTS AND I VENTURE TO ASSERT THAT IT WAS THEY THAT SMELT SO OF FIR
HIS MOTHER NOW CAME HOME FOR SHE HAD BEEN OUT AND TOOK LITTLE AUGUSTA ON HER ARM
AND WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS AT THE WALL WHERE THE MORTAR HAD FALLEN OUT HE COULD SIT AND FIND OUT THERE THE STRANGEST FIGURES IMAGINABLE
IT WAS A LADY
LOCKE AND ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN NEW YORK
THEY KNOW THE WHOLE FOREST HERE BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT WE HAVE A WIFE FOR HIM SAID THE GNATS
THE LONG WILLOW-LEAVES WERE QUITE YELLOW AND THE FOG DRIPPED FROM THEM LIKE WATER
THE IRON RAILINGS LOOK JUST LIKE THE DOOR TO AN OLD FAMILY VAULT AND THEN THEY HAVE BRASS TOPS--THAT'S SO STUPID ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WERE ALSO NEW AND NEAT HOUSES AND THEY THOUGHT JUST AS THE OTHERS DID
THE WATER TRICKLED DOWN FROM HER HAIR AND HER CLOTHES CLUNG TO HER BODY
THEY THRUST AT THE HORRID SNOW-FLAKES WITH THEIR SPEARS SO THAT THEY FLEW INTO A THOUSAND PIECES
AND YET SOME ONE LIVED THERE FOR THERE STOOD FLOWERS IN THE BALCONY--THEY GREW SO WELL IN THE SUN'S HEAT
THEN THE WICKED SPRITE LAUGHED TILL HE ALMOST CHOKED FOR ALL THIS TICKLED HIS FANCY
FROM ALL THE WINDOWS THE CANDLES WERE GLEAMING AND IT SMELT SO DELICIOUSLY OF ROAST GOOSE FOR YOU KNOW IT WAS NEW YEAR'S EVE
HOWEVER SOMEBODY WAS CLOSE BESIDE HIM
HEAVEN HELP ME CRIED HE
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SAID THE SUNSHINE
SO THE LITTLE MAIDEN WALKED ON WITH HER TINY NAKED FEET THAT WERE QUITE RED AND BLUE FROM COLD
BUT TIS THE AIR WHICH ENABLES THEE TO BREATHE SAID THE POET'S VOICE
AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF EIGHT DAYS HE OBSERVED TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT A NEW SHADOW CAME IN THE SUNSHINE
SHE HAD NEW CLOTHES AND WAS TO HAVE NEW SHOES ALSO
AND PUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THE GALOSHES IN SEARCH OF AN OWNER BESIDE HIS OWN IN THE CORNER
AND OUT OF BED HE JUMPED AND READ IN HIS BOOK AND NOW ALL AT ONCE HE KNEW HIS WHOLE LESSON
HE WAS BOLD AND NICELY BEHAVED
WHEN--THE MATCH WENT OUT AND NOTHING BUT THE THICK COLD DAMP WALL WAS LEFT BEHIND
COME NOW
AND POOR KAY HAD GOT ANOTHER PIECE RIGHT IN HIS HEART
THE COPYING-CLERK TURNED ROUND AND SPOKE AWHILE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE REPORTS AND LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION
AND SHE FLEW PAST OLD CASTLES OF BY-GONE DAYS OF CHIVALRY WHERE THE RED WALLS AND THE EMBATTLED GABLES WERE MIRRORED IN THE CANAL WHERE THE SWANS WERE SWIMMING AND PEERED UP INTO THE OLD COOL AVENUES
AND THE FIR TREE WAS STUCK UPRIGHT IN A CASK THAT WAS FILLED WITH SAND
HEAR ME NOT AND SHE BOWED HER HEAD DOWN IN HER LAP AND DEATH TOOK HER CHILD AND WENT WITH IT INTO THE UNKNOWN LAND
I CAME OUT MATURED
HE WORE LONG WHITE GARMENTS
ROME HAS ITS CORSO NAPLES ITS TOLEDO"--"AH
AM I TO DO NOTHING WHATEVER FOR HE WAS ONE OF THE COMPANY AND HAD DONE WHAT HE HAD TO DO
A BEGINNING EVERY AUTHOR HAS SOME PECULIARITY IN HIS DESCRIPTIONS OR IN HIS STYLE OF WRITING
SHE IS SORROWING FOR ME AS SHE DID FOR LITTLE KAY
GERDA JUMPED FOR JOY AND PLAYED TILL THE SUN SET BEHIND THE TALL CHERRY-TREE
HE HAD PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOW ABOVE AND BELOW--HE HAD SEEN BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER AND SO HE COULD ANSWER THE PRINCESS AND MAKE INSINUATIONS SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE ASTONISHED
AND THERE PASSED DAYS AND YEARS--YES
SOME ONE MUST HAVE SLIPPED IT SLYLY INTO MY POCKET FOR A JOKE
THE BOXES WERE VERY HIGH AND THE CHILDREN KNEW THAT THEY MUST NOT CREEP OVER THEM
HIGHER AND HIGHER STILL THEY FLEW NEARER AND NEARER TO THE STARS WHEN SUDDENLY THE MIRROR SHOOK SO TERRIBLY WITH GRINNING THAT IT FLEW OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND FELL TO THE EARTH WHERE IT WAS DASHED IN A HUNDRED MILLION AND MORE PIECES
ALL WAS BURDOCKS AND THERE LIVED THE TWO LAST VENERABLE OLD SNAILS
WHAT A MAGNIFICENT TRAIN THERE IS TO THE MANTLE
IF I ONLY HAD THE BARONY DO YOU SEEK MY HAND SAID THE SCISSORS
BUT HER ROBE WAS STILL THE SAME GREEN STUFF WITH WHITE FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD WORN BEFORE
IT WAS THE FAIRY OF CARE AND THE EMISSARY OF FORTUNE
YES THEN I WAS A LITTLE WILD BOY WHO DID NOT GO TO SCHOOL VERY REGULARLY
THE RAVEN OF THE WOODS WHO WAS NOW MARRIED ACCOMPANIED HER FOR THE FIRST THREE MILES
YOU ALWAYS SAT AND LOOKED OVER TO THE ANTECHAMBER
ONE DAY TWO ROGUES CALLING THEMSELVES WEAVERS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE
NOW A MERRY LIFE WILL BEGIN AGAIN THOUGHT THE TREE
GERDA WELL REMEMBERED HOW LARGE AND STRANGE THE SNOW-FLAKES APPEARED WHEN SHE ONCE SAW THEM THROUGH A MAGNIFYING-GLASS
YET I MUST TO PLEASE MY FANCY CONTINUE QUITE QUIETLY AND ADD
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS SOMETHING COMMON IS IT NOT SAID THE SHADOW
BEING NOW CONVINCED THAT HE HAD FOUND A REAL PRINCESS
BUT LITTLE DENMARK MUST TAKE CARE WHAT IT IS ABOUT AND NOT RUN COUNTER TO THE MOON
THEIR BROTHER WHO IS OLDER THAN THEY ARE STANDS UP IN THE SWING
UPON IT WAS A SPLENDID PORCELAIN SERVICE AND THE ROAST GOOSE WAS STEAMING FAMOUSLY WITH ITS STUFFING OF APPLE AND DRIED PLUMS
BUT NOW WE SHALL SEE HOW KAY FARED
BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER
ON THE FLOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SAT LIKE A DALAI-LAMA THE INSIGNIFICANT SELF OF THE PERSON QUITE CONFOUNDED AT HIS OWN GREATNESS
BUT I DID NOT THEN KNOW HOW HAPPY I WAS IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY
THE GRASSHOPPER JUMPED ONLY HALF AS HIGH
AND THE LOVING GOD WILL DO SO AT ALL TIMES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BOOK UNDER TUK'S PILLOW BEGAN SCRAPING AND SCRATCHING
WHO THOUGHT IT WAS THEIR NEIGHBOR WHO NODDED TO THEM
ONLY A BALCONY
AND SHE CAN NEVER REMAIN QUIETLY ON THE EARTH BUT GOES UP AGAIN INTO THE BLACK CLOUDS
BUT WHEN SUNDAY RETURNED SHE SAID WELL NOW I HAVE SUFFERED AND STRUGGLED ENOUGH
THE WHOLE OF THE GROUND-FLOOR WAS A ROW OF SHOPS AND THERE PEOPLE COULD NOT ALWAYS BE RUNNING THROUGH
HERE I LIE CAPITALLY PRASTOE A STILL SMALLER TOWN THAN KJOGE
THAT I WILL NOT TELL THEE SAID DEATH
WHAT SONG COULD THE RANUNCULUS SING
HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO CAPITALLY FOR A CRADLE WHEN HE SOME DAY OR OTHER SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN HIMSELF
LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF INNOCENCE EXCLAIMED HIS FATHER
I SAW THY TEARS WHILST THOU SANG'ST THEM I WILL SING THEM ALL ALL SAID THE MOTHER
SHE THOUGHT OF HER COUNTRY AND KINGDOM AND OF THE MANY PERSONS SHE WOULD HAVE TO REIGN OVER
IT WAS SO THICK AND THE FOLIAGE SO DENSE THAT IT WAS QUITE FATIGUING TO PROCEED
THEN HE WILL BE AFRAID
AND OUT OF THE OPENINGS MAGPIES AND ROOKS WERE FLYING
AND SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AND TURNED BACK AND REPENTED OF HER SIN FROM HER HEART
THE SUN SHONE ON HIM
YOU WILL SUFFER NEITHER HUNGER NOR THIRST
BUT HOW THEY GROW THERE AND HOW IT IS THERE I DARE NOT TELL THEE GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD SAID THE MOTHER AND SHE WEPT AND PRAYED
BEFORE THE GARDEN THERE WAS A LARGE IRON RAILING WITH AN IRON DOOR IT LOOKED QUITE SPLENDID AND PEOPLE STOOD STILL AND PEEPED IN AND THE SPARROWS HUNG BY SCORES IN THE VINE AND CHATTERED AWAY AT EACH OTHER AS WELL AS THEY COULD BUT IT WAS NOT ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE FOR THEY COULD NOT REMEMBER IT SO MANY YEARS HAD PASSED--SO MANY THAT THE LITTLE BOY HAD GROWN UP TO A WHOLE MAN YES A CLEVER MAN AND A PLEASURE TO HIS PARENTS
HAVE PITY THOU WHO ALL MAN'S WANTS DOST SEE
MIRTH NEVER REIGNED THERE
A WHITE HEN CARRIES HIS SLEDGE
OH HOW ODOROUS I AM
AS TO THE REST THE MAN WAS VERY FINELY DRESSED--HE MUST BE A GENTLEMAN
WE ARE JUST COME TO HIM
ONLY IMAGINE--YES IT IS TRUE SUCH A POOR SHADOW-SKULL CANNOT BEAR MUCH--ONLY THINK MY SHADOW HAS BECOME MAD
NOW THERE WAS AN OLD MANOR-HOUSE WHERE THEY NO LONGER ATE SNAILS THEY WERE QUITE EXTINCT
IT IS REALLY UNPARDONABLE THAT THERE ARE NO LAMPS HERE
NOW AND THEN HE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT AND THE LITTLE BOY NODDED TO HIM AND THE OLD MAN NODDED AGAIN AND SO THEY BECAME ACQUAINTANCES AND THEN THEY WERE FRIENDS ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO EACH OTHER--BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE BUT I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF WHAT THOUGHT THE PRINCESS
ALL AROUND IT LOOKED SO COLD AND RAW
I CERTAINLY AM NOT STUPID THOUGHT THE MESSENGER
SO THAT WHEN THEY AGAIN DANCED TOGETHER SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATE BUT SHE WAS OF ICE OF DAZZLING SPARKLING ICE
AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN WHO WE KNOW WAS NO ONE ELSE BUT OLD NANNY KEPT ON CRYING OUT NOW WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
HOW GLADLY WOULD HE HAVE SUNK UPON HIS KNEES
WE KNEW THEM BOTH
THEY RUN TO AND FRO AS IF THEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO AND THEY CERTAINLY KNOW OF A WIFE FOR OUR LITTLE SNAIL I KNOW ONE SURE ENOUGH--THE MOST CHARMING ONE SAID ONE OF THE ANTS
SOME PRAISED THAT PERIOD AS FAR MORE INTERESTING FAR MORE POETICAL THAN OUR OWN TOO SOBER PRESENT
EACH ONE KEPT TO HIS OWN OPINION AND SO THEY SEPARATED
AND THESE ARE THE OLD THOUGHTS WITH WHAT THEY MAY BRING WITH THEM
THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY FELT A WISH TO GO THITHER
THAT I AM A MAN AND THAT THOU ART A SHADOW--THOU ART ONLY DRESSED UP THERE IS NO ONE WHO WILL BELIEVE IT SAID THE SHADOW
I STRIKE BAD PEOPLE'S HEADS OFF
SOME LOOKED LIKE LARGE UGLY PORCUPINES
BUT MIND HE SHALL HAVE NO MORE KISSES HE WILL HAVE A HUNDRED KISSES FROM THE PRINCESS SAID THE LADY WHO HAD BEEN TO ASK
WHAT ARE YOU DOING CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL
HAST THOU NOT SEEN DEATH GO PAST WITH MY LITTLE CHILD SAID THE MOTHER
THE LONG WHITE CURTAINS HUNG DOWN FROM THE WINDOWS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR STOOD THE BLACK COFFIN
WERE I BUT SUCH A HIGH TREE AS THE OTHERS ARE SIGHED HE
TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AND ALL THE FOLKS MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET--CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH--AND CANDLES BURNT--YES ABOVE A THOUSAND LIGHTS WERE BURNING--AND THE ONE TALKED AND THE OTHER SUNG
THE ROSES HUNG SO FRESH AND ODOROUS OVER THE BALUSTRADE THE LINDENS WERE IN BLOSSOM THE SWALLOWS FLEW BY AND SAID QUIRRE-VIT
THAT IS THE HAPPIEST THING IN THE WORLD
TEN OR TWELVE CRIPPLED-BEGGARS HAD ENCAMPED OUTSIDE
SHE BLEW UPON US YOUNG ONES
AH NO REPLIED CARE
I SHALL SPEAK ABOUT IT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
A LITTLE FLOWER ON SUNDAY AND THEN THEY ENTERED A CHAMBER WHERE THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH HOG'S LEATHER AND PRINTED WITH GOLD FLOWERS
THE FLOOR WAS TOO OPEN--THE PEWTER SOLDIER HAD FALLEN THROUGH A CREVICE AND THERE HE LAY AS IN AN OPEN TOMB
AND FURTHERMORE THE PRINCE HAD A NIGHTINGALE WHO COULD SING IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ALL SWEET MELODIES DWELT IN HER LITTLE THROAT
WHERE SHALL WE GET A WIFE FOR HIM
NO BUT THEY CAN CRY
NO FRIEND YOU SHOULD BUT TRY WHAT IT IS TO SIT FROM ONE YEAR'S END TO THE OTHER OCCUPIED WITH AND JUDGING THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS THE POET SHOOK HIS HEAD THE COPYING-CLERK DID THE SAME
AH IF IT WERE BUT A LITTLE PUSSY-CAT SAID SHE
ONE COULD SEE FROM THE STREET RIGHT INTO THE ROOM WITH THE HOG'S-LEATHER HANGING WHICH WAS SLASHED AND TORN
MAKE THYSELF AS FREE AS ANYONE ELSE
SOON AFTER CAME THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRAND-CHILDREN
EVERY TIME HE WAS GOING TO UNTIE HIS SLEDGE THE PERSON NODDED TO HIM AND THEN KAY SAT QUIET
YES IT IS A REAL BIRD SAID THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT IT
AND THE OLD WASHERWOMAN POPPED HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR NODDED TO HIM FRIENDLY AND SAID THANKS MANY THANKS MY GOOD CHILD FOR YOUR HELP
THEY THEMSELVES KNEW NOT HOW OLD THEY WERE BUT THEY COULD REMEMBER VERY WELL THAT THERE HAD BEEN MANY MORE
AT THE SAME TIME POINTING TO THE EMPTY FRAMES
IF ONE COULD BUT SEE INTO THEIR HEARTS--YES THAT WOULD BE A REVELATION--A SORT OF BAZAR
I HAVE JUST SUCH A FEELING ON HEARING YOU SAY THOU TO ME
THEY DROVE WITH EACH OTHER THEY RODE AND WALKED TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE AND BEHIND JUST AS THE SUN WAS
IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP
IT IS MORE THAN PRETTY SAID THE EMPEROR IT IS CHARMING BUT THE PRINCESS TOUCHED IT AND WAS ALMOST READY TO CRY
EVERY WISH AS REGARDS TIME OR PLACE OR STATE OF BEING WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FULFILLED AND SO AT LAST MAN WILL BE HAPPY HERE BELOW DO YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE IT REPLIED CARE IN A SEVERE TONE OF REPROACH
THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE
AND SHE POSITIVELY REFUSED TO SEE THE PRINCE
IT IS DREADFULLY COLD SAID THE MOUSE
SHE RECOGNISED HIM FLEW TO EMBRACE HIM AND CRIED OUT HER ARMS FIRMLY HOLDING HIM THE WHILE KAY SWEET LITTLE KAY
BUT YET HE WOULD PREFER SENDING SOMEBODY ELSE TO BRING HIM INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE WEAVERS AND THEIR WORK BEFORE HE TROUBLED HIMSELF IN THE AFFAIR
WHERE DID THEY GO TO
THE POOR HORSES TORTURED ALMOST TO DEATH SUFFERED MOST FROM THIS TRULY EGYPTIAN PLAGUE
HAVE I WRITTEN THE TRAGEDY
WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH
AND SEE WHAT THOU WAST ABOUT TO DISTURB AND DESTROY AND SHE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WELL
SHE COULD NOT ACCOMPANY GERDA BECAUSE SHE SUFFERED FROM HEADACHE SINCE SHE HAD HAD A FIXED APPOINTMENT AND ATE SO MUCH
IT WAS A JOYFUL MEETING
FOR WHO HAS NOT AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE HAD A LYRICAL MOMENT
UNFORTUNATELY THE PLEASURE LASTED BUT A MOMENT
WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE PALACE OF THE SNOW QUEEN AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTERWARD
THEY LIE CLOSE TO THE DOOR THE WORTHY MAN WAS INCLINED TO RING AND DELIVER THEM AT THE HOUSE FOR THERE WAS STILL A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW
YOU STOOD VERY SERIOUSLY ALL TOGETHER ALTHOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH
IT IS MOST REMARKABLE
IT WAS SPLENDID TO LOOK AT
ONE MIGHT REALLY WRITE A VERY PRETTY COMEDY UPON IT HE NOW FLUTTERED DOWN INTO THE GRASS TURNED HIS HEAD GRACEFULLY ON EVERY SIDE AND WITH HIS BILL PECKED THE PLIANT BLADES OF GRASS WHICH IN COMPARISON TO HIS PRESENT SIZE SEEMED AS MAJESTIC AS THE PALM-BRANCHES OF NORTHERN AFRICA
BUT I NEVER BEFORE WAS AWARE OF SUCH MAD FREAKS AS THESE AND UP HE FLEW INTO THE GREEN ROOF AND SANG
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO KNOW HIM AND THEY WALK ALONG WITH HIM ARM IN ARM AS IF HE TOO WERE A STUDENT LIKE THEMSELVES
SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED
AND SHE WENT TO THE OTHER FLOWERS LOOKED INTO THEIR CUPS AND ASKED DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE LITTLE KAY IS BUT EVERY FLOWER STOOD IN THE SUNSHINE AND DREAMED ITS OWN FAIRY TALE OR ITS OWN STORY
AND THE ROSE-TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUSH SAT A FRIENDLY-LOOKING OLD WOMAN IN A MOST STRANGE DRESS
ARE YOU STILL COLD ASKED SHE
AT THE NEXT CORNER HUNG A VOTIVE LAMP BEFORE A MADONNA BUT THE LIGHT IT GAVE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL
THEN THERE STOOD A THORN-BUSH
BUT ALL SHE ASKED FOR WAS THIS POESY
HE MUST BE THE WISEST MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD
SO FAR ALL WENT ON WELL
DO YOU NOT KNOW YOUR OLD SHADOW
THE LITTLE BOY HEARD HIS PARENTS SAY THE OLD MAN OPPOSITE IS VERY WELL OFF BUT HE IS SO VERY VERY LONELY THE SUNDAY FOLLOWING THE LITTLE BOY TOOK SOMETHING AND WRAPPED IT UP IN A PIECE OF PAPER WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
IT WILL BE A REAL BLESSING TO MY PEOPLE AND KINGDOM IF I CHOOSE HIM FOR MY CONSORT--I WILL DO IT THEY WERE SOON AGREED BOTH THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW
YOU CERTAINLY THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER MORE RETURN
DON'T YOU SEE THE FARM-HOUSE YONDER
DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVED IN OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE SAID THE SHADOW
BUT WHAT'S THIS HE TURNED ROUND ANEW FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY ILL
HOW DID YOU GET UPON THE LARGE RAPID RIVER TO BE DRIVEN ABOUT SO IN THE WIDE WORLD AND THEN THE OLD WOMAN WENT INTO THE WATER CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BOAT WITH HER CROOKED STICK DREW IT TO THE BANK AND LIFTED LITTLE GERDA OUT
WE WILL THEREFORE NOT LISTEN TO WHAT WAS SPOKEN AND ON NO CONDITION RUN IN THE POSSIBILITY OF TELLING TALES OUT OF SCHOOL
I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT AND REMEMBER ALL THAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME
AND HE CARVED OUT LITTLE WOODEN FEET FOR HER AND CRUTCHES TAUGHT HER THE PSALM CRIMINALS ALWAYS SING
HE OBSERVED IT PERFECTLY AND LAUGHED IN HIS HEART
AS A MAN I WAS ASHAMED TO GO AS I DID
YOU ARE A MERRY FELLOW SAID THE OLD MAN
SHE MUST ADVISE US
AND HIS EYES ROLLED IN HIS HEAD
THE SNOW-FLAKES GREW LARGER AND LARGER TILL AT LAST THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE GREAT WHITE FOWLS
I WILL NOT DO IT
NO PICTURE-BOOK COULD BE GAYER OR MORE BEAUTIFUL
AND THEN THE RAVEN BADE HER FAREWELL AND THIS WAS THE MOST PAINFUL SEPARATION OF ALL
THE LIGHT REALLY HURT HIS EYES
SHE TOOK IT OUT OF THE KITCHEN WHERE THERE IS BREAD ENOUGH
HE HAD BROUGHT ANOTHER A YOUNG ONE WITH HIM WHOSE UDDER WAS FILLED WITH MILK WHICH HE GAVE TO THE LITTLE ONES AND KISSED THEIR LIPS
THE PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS ASSISTED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE THEMSELVES AND WISHED HER ALL SUCCESS
AND WHEN THE STRANGER MOVED THE SHADOW ALSO MOVED
AND SOMETHING RUSHED PAST
AND THAT MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE
THE POOR WOMAN CAN HARDLY DRAG HERSELF ALONG AND SHE MUST NOW DRAG THE PAIL HOME FROM THE FOUNTAIN
SHE LAMENTS MOST PITEOUSLY BUT IT'S ALL MERE TALK AND STUFF
ART THOU GOING AND THEN HE NODDED TO THE SHADOW AND THE SHADOW NODDED AGAIN
YET THEY LOOKED DIFFERENT TO US
SHE HAD ONLY THE REMAINS OF THE BURNT-OUT MATCH IN HER HAND
THE AUDACIOUS INSECT POPULATION DID NOT CEASE TO STING
ALL SEEMED TO HIM IN PROPER ORDER AS USUAL
THY SILENCE TEACHES NOUGHT THOU LEADEST ONLY TO THE NEAR GRAVE'S BRINK
COME IN COME IN AND I WILL SOON RESTORE THEE
BUT I KNEW HER IN BY-GONE DAYS AND NOW SHE HAS BEEN DEAD AND GONE THESE FIFTY YEARS UNDER THE PICTURE IN A GLAZED FRAME THERE HUNG A BOUQUET OF WITHERED FLOWERS
I SEEM IN UNUSUALLY GOOD SPIRITS
AND TOWARDS EVENING THE MOON ROSE ROUND AND LARGE AND THE HAYCOCKS IN THE MEADOWS SMELT SO SWEETLY
BUT I DO NOT WISH YOU TO BE COLD
FOR IN REALITY IT HAD NOT GOT LITTLE KAY
ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THE FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FLYING ABOUT HE SPREAD THE SKIRTS OF HIS BLUE COAT AND CAUGHT THE SNOW AS IT FELL
NO ONE CAN IMITATE YOU I KNOW IT SAID THE SCISSORS
YES YES SAID THE RAVEN YOU MAY BELIEVE IT
NOW JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WATCHMAN
BUT THE REINDEER DARED NOT STAND STILL
AND ACROSS IT SHE MUST GO IF SHE WOULD FIND HER CHILD
AND ONE GETS IN BY THE NECK AND BY THE NECK ONE MUST GET OUT AGAIN
THE COACHMAN WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AFTER AND CATCH HOLD OF HER AND HE LIFTED HER IN THE CARRIAGE BUT HER FEET CONTINUED TO DANCE SO THAT SHE TROD ON THE OLD LADY DREADFULLY
NO DOUBT IT WAS THAT ACCURSED POETICAL NATURE WHICH HAS METAMORPHOSED ME INTO SUCH A POOR HARMLESS LITTLE CREATURE
BUT DO NOT STOP ME NOW--I MAY OVERTAKE HIM--I MAY FIND MY CHILD BUT NIGHT STOOD STILL AND MUTE
ALL THE NEW BOOTHS WITH THEIR NOT VERY COURTIER-LIKE SWARM OF SEAMEN WOULD JOIN THEM OUT OF CURIOSITY AND WOULD GREET HIM WITH A WILD HURRAH WHILE HE WAS STANDING IN HIS PILLORY
BUT IT IS DELIGHTFUL NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN DELIGHTFUL SHOUTED SOMETHING CLOSE BY
THEY HOWEVER IMAGINED HE WAS TALKING RUSSIAN
THE RICH SHOEMAKER IN THE CITY TOOK THE MEASURE OF HER LITTLE FOOT
AND THE BRASS BALLS ON THE IRON RAILINGS SHONE MUCH BRIGHTER THAN EVER
BUT--THE SMALL FLAME WENT OUT THE STOVE VANISHED
THE SNOW QUEEN FIRST STORY
SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
SUCH METEOROUS APPEARANCES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY--THAT THEY ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY ARE CAUSED PRINCIPALLY BY ELECTRICITY THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST HIM AND HEARD HIS SPEECH STARED AT HIM IN WONDERMENT
YOU DO NOT SAY WHETHER THE STUFF PLEASES YOU OH IT IS EXCELLENT REPLIED THE OLD MINISTER LOOKING AT THE LOOM THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES
I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
THE GIRL LAUGHED AND PULLED GERDA INTO BED WITH HER
I AM CERTAINLY VERY ILL HE NOW HIT UPON A HALF-OPEN DOOR THROUGH A CHINK OF WHICH A FAINT LIGHT SHONE
DO NOT FORGET THE DIET SAID KING HROAR ROESKILDE ONCE THE CAPITAL OF DENMARK
GRIEF AND TORMENT FOLLOWED HIM AND WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL WAS TO MOST PERSONS LIKE ROSES FOR A COW
HE HAD WINGS WHICH REACHED FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO THE EARTH
NOT ONE WAS TO BE SEEN
BUT NONE SHARED IT WITH HIS NEIGHBOR FOR EACH THOUGHT LET HIM LOOK HUNGRY AND THEN THE PRINCESS WON'T HAVE HIM BUT KAY--LITTLE KAY SAID GERDA WHEN DID HE COME
IT WAS THE VERY SAME COURT-YARD WHERE WE NOW ARE AND WE STUCK SLIPS IN THE GROUND AND MADE A GARDEN I REMEMBER IT WELL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THE SMOKE DISAPPEARED UNDER THE STONES AND HAD TO SEEK ITS OWN EGRESS
AND WHEN THEY CAME TO A CLUMP OF WILLOWS WHICH GREW ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FOREST THEY SAT DOWN AND LOOKED UP AT THE LONG BRANCHES AND FANCIED THEY WERE NOW IN THE DEPTH OF THE GREEN WOOD
AND NOW THEY WERE IN LAPLAND
SHE WAS LATELY IT IS SAID SITTING ON HER THRONE--WHICH IS NOT VERY AMUSING AFTER ALL--WHEN SHE BEGAN HUMMING AN OLD TUNE AND IT WAS JUST OH WHY SHOULD I NOT BE MARRIED THAT SONG IS NOT WITHOUT ITS MEANING SAID SHE AND SO THEN SHE WAS DETERMINED TO MARRY
ALL HAD HELMS ON THEIR HEADS AND LANCES AND SHIELDS IN THEIR HANDS
HEREUPON HE WANDERED INTO A BOUDOIR FORMED ENTIRELY OF MIRRORS LIKE THE ONE IN CASTLE ROSENBURG
HE TOOK HIS DEPARTURE HIMSELF
THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH ME
I SAT ONE EVENING SUNK IN DREAMS OF BLISS A MAID OF SEVEN YEARS OLD GAVE ME A KISS I AT THAT TIME WAS RICH IN POESY AND TALES OF OLD THOUGH POOR AS POOR COULD BE
UGH
UGH
AND THE ELDER-FLOWERS CAME FORTH SO FRESH AND WHITE AND SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES
FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
DEATH IS AN ELECTRIC SHOCK WHICH OUR HEART RECEIVES
NOW YOU LOOK ABOUT THE HANDS JUST LIKE MY UGLY OLD MOTHER AND GERDA WEPT FOR JOY
THESE POLICE-REPORTS WILL SOON STEM THE TORRENT OF MY IDEAS AND EFFECTUALLY HINDER ANY REBELLIOUS OVERFLOWING OF THE TIME-WORN BANKS OF OFFICIAL DUTIES
THERE IS ONE IN THE TEA-POT AND THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED AT THE TEA-POT
THE ENGLISH PIRATES HAD THEY SAID MOST SHAMEFULLY TAKEN THEIR SHIPS WHILE IN THE ROADSTEAD
AND WHEN THE OTHERS REACHED THE WILLOW-TREE WHERE THE CONFECTIONER WAS THEY SAID NOW WE ARE THERE
HE WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AND HE TRIED TO REPEAT THE LORD'S PRAYER
THOU WOULD'ST NOT HAVE AN HONORABLE PRINCE
THEY JUST REACH UP TO YOUR ELBOW
NOW THAT WOULD BE A VERY PRETTY JOKE IF THE SPIRIT WHEN IT CAME BACK AND LOOKED FOR THE BODY IN EAST STREET WERE NOT TO FIND ONE
IF MY MISTRESS AND ALL HER FRIENDS CAN LAUGH AT WHAT I SAY SO MAY YOU TOO I SHOULD THINK
HORSES WITH FLOWING MANES AND THIN LEGS HUNTSMEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK
BUT HERE THE GLASSES MAGNIFIED TO AN ASTONISHING DEGREE
AND OUT-OF-DOORS THERE WAS QUITE A SNOW-STORM
THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW WENT OUT ON THE BALCONY TO SHOW THEMSELVES AND GET ANOTHER HURRAH
THE KING'S SON GOT SOME SCRATCHES TOO
ABOVE THEM FLEW LARGE SCREAMING CROWS BUT HIGHER UP APPEARED THE MOON QUITE LARGE AND BRIGHT
NOBODY HAD BOUGHT ANYTHING OF HER THE WHOLE LIVELONG DAY
I FISHED THEM UP FROM THE LAKE THEY SHONE SO BRIGHT
CHARMANT EXCLAIMED THE LADIES
HE FOUND HOWEVER A LITTLE SIDE-DOOR OPEN AND THROUGH THIS HE WENT AND STEPPED INTO OUR NEW MARKET OF THE PRESENT TIME
BUT NOW THEY WERE LARGE AND TERRIFIC IN ANOTHER MANNER--THEY WERE ALL ALIVE
AND WHAT AN ODOUR
THE YOUNGER IT IS TRUE WAS NOT DAME FORTUNE HERSELF BUT ONE OF THE WAITING-MAIDS OF HER HANDMAIDENS WHO CARRY ABOUT THE LESSER GOOD THINGS THAT SHE DISTRIBUTES
I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER SHADOW AGAIN
ON HE RAN TILL HE CAME TO THE GREAT BUSH WITH THE RED BERRIES AND THERE HE SET GERDA DOWN KISSED HER MOUTH WHILE LARGE BRIGHT TEARS FLOWED FROM THE ANIMAL'S EYES AND THEN BACK HE WENT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
THE GILDING DECAYS BUT HOG'S LEATHER STAYS THIS THE PEWTER SOLDIER DID NOT BELIEVE
THE WINE EVEN WAS NOT WITHOUT A DISGUSTING TASTE--IT WAS LIKE A MEDICINAL DRAUGHT
WERE CHRISTMAS BUT COME
WE HAVE TRAVELLED FAST SAID SHE
HOW MAGNIFICENT WAS THE SIGHT FROM THIS HEIGHT
YES AND WHITHER
COME UNDER MY BEARSKIN AND SHE PUT HIM IN THE SLEDGE BESIDE HER WRAPPED THE FUR ROUND HIM AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE SINKING IN A SNOW-WREATH
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VILLAGE LIVED OLD DAME SHOEMAKER
AND AT LAST THEY CAME INTO THE BEDCHAMBER
YEARS AND DAYS PASSED AWAY THEN THE SHADOW CAME AGAIN
UP THERE IS THE RABBLE OF THE WOOD CONTINUED SHE POINTING TO SEVERAL LATHS WHICH WERE FASTENED BEFORE A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE WALL
WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS THEN TWO SERVANTS CAME IN RICH LIVERY AND CARRIED THE FIR TREE INTO A LARGE AND SPLENDID DRAWING-ROOM
YOU HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILES TO GO BEFORE YOU GET TO FINLAND
THEY HAD THE MOST WONDROUS SHAPES
THE OTHERS HOWEVER DID MAKE FUN OF HIM AFTER ALL
BUT NOT TO THE ROUND TOWER OR TO FRIEDERICKSBERG
HE DID SO
WHAT CHANGE--WHAT MAGNIFICENCE
SHE SAT DOWN ON A LARGE STONE AND WHEN SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER SHE SAW THAT THE SUMMER HAD PASSED
HER EYES GAZED FIXEDLY LIKE TWO STARS
AND WHEN THE HOUSEDOG SNUFFED AT HIM WITH HIS NOSE HE CONFESSED THE LEAP-FROG WAS OF GOOD FAMILY
I AM GOING TO MARRY THE KING'S DAUGHTER AND THE NUPTIALS ARE TO TAKE PLACE THIS EVENING NAY THIS IS GOING TOO FAR SAID THE LEARNED MAN
LET ME SEE IF YOU HAVE MY FLOWER STILL AND THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS PRAYER-BOOK
TIS I WHO SIT IN THE TREE THAT GROWS AND GROWS
THERE GOES THE OLD WASHERWOMAN OVER THE WAY SAID HIS MOTHER AS SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW
AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED
THERE GREW WATER PLANTS SOME SO FRESH OTHERS HALF SICK THE WATER-SNAKES LAY DOWN ON THEM AND BLACK CRABS PINCHED THEIR STALKS
GOOD HEAVENS
GOOD HEAVENS
HE KNOWS NOT WHAT I TERM PRIVATION
WHAT SHALL I HEAR NOW I WONDER AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
THE PITCH-BLACK CLOUDS POURED DOWN THEIR CONTENTS IN STILL HEAVIER TORRENTS
I AM QUITE READY ANSWERED THE EMPEROR
THE SWINEHERD THERE WAS ONCE A POOR PRINCE WHO HAD A KINGDOM
ONE SOLITARY TOWER ONLY AND SOME REMAINS OF A WALL SHOW WHERE THE CASTLE ONCE STOOD
THE GOOD OLD SOUL
THE LIGHTS OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER SHE SAW THEM NOW AS STARS IN HEAVEN
HE TWINES HIS ARMS ROUND THE CORDS TO HOLD HIMSELF FAST FOR IN ONE HAND HE HAS A LITTLE CUP AND IN THE OTHER A CLAY-PIPE
THAT WERE SAD INDEED SAID THE BOY AND HE TOOK THE BOW IN HIS HAND AND EXAMINED IT ON EVERY SIDE
HOW HAPPY YOU MUST HAVE BEEN I SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATED
DDSA WAS HEARD IN THE SKY
THEN CAME HALBERDIERS AND SOME ARMED WITH CROSS-BOWS
HE LAY WITH HIS FEET TOWARDS A DOORWAY AND EXACTLY OPPOSITE SAT THE WATCHMAN ASLEEP
HE GOES FASTER THAN THE WIND AND HE NEVER BRINGS BACK WHAT HE TAKES OH ONLY TELL ME WHICH WAY HE WENT SAID THE MOTHER
AND THEN THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED
THE LEAP-FROG A FLEA A GRASSHOPPER AND A LEAP-FROG ONCE WANTED TO SEE WHICH COULD JUMP HIGHEST
GOOD HEAVENS SIGHED HE
IF HE UNDOES THE THIRD AND FOURTH THEN IT RAGES SO THAT THE FORESTS ARE UPTURNED
GOOD DAY TO MY LORD THE EMPEROR SAID HE
AND CLOSE BESIDE THEM SAT AN OLD KING WITH A GOLDEN CROWN UPON HIS WHITE HEAD
SHE SAID SHE WAS A REAL PRINCESS
BUT IN ORDER TO HURT NOBODY HE WRAPS HIS WITTY ORACULAR JUDGMENTS IN A TRANSPARENT VEIL OR RATHER IN A LURID THUNDERCLOUD SHOOTING FORTH BRIGHT SPARKS OF WIT THAT THEY MAY FALL IN THE POWDER-MAGAZINE OF THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE THE HUMOROUS POEM WAS ADMIRABLY RECITED AND THE SPEAKER MUCH APPLAUDED
AND IN HONOR OF IT A PAIR OF WALKING-SHOES OR GALOSHES HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME WHICH I AM TO CARRY TO MANKIND
IT WAS AGAIN LIGHT AND IN THE LUSTRE THERE STOOD THE OLD GRANDMOTHER SO BRIGHT AND RADIANT SO MILD AND WITH SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF LOVE
THIRD STORY
AMONGST OTHER THINGS THEY SPOKE OF THE MIDDLE AGES
BUT COPENHAGEN HAS ITS EAST STREET HERE THEN WE WILL STAY FOR THE PRESENT
AND THE TIME CAME AND OFFICER WAS I
REFLECTING ON THE MATTER AND WITHOUT LOOKING RIGHT OR LEFT THE COUNCILLOR WENT THROUGH EAST STREET AND ACROSS THE HABRO-PLATZ
HE HAD GONE OUT AND GOT HIS FEET WET
I BECOME FAT AND IT IS THAT ONE WANTS TO BECOME
AND THEN ANOTHER LITTLE ONE CAME
A ROW OF BUILDINGS FOR SEAMEN IN COPENHAGEN
POESY
AND WHEN THE MAN WHO WENT ON ERRANDS CAME PAST HE SAID TO HIM I SAY MASTER
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF AT THE SAME MOMENT A LARGE BIRD FLEW PAST THE WINDOW
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WICKED SPRITE INDEED HE WAS THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL SPRITES
THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL
I HEARD IT ON MY HAPPIEST EVENING
WHAT IS ALL THIS SAID HE WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HE BOXED THE PRINCESS'S EARS WITH HIS SLIPPER JUST AS THE SWINEHERD WAS TAKING THE EIGHTY-SIXTH KISS
IN IT HE LAY AND THOUGHT ABOUT HIS GEOGRAPHY LESSON AND OF ZEALAND AND OF ALL THAT HIS MASTER HAD TOLD HIM
THEY DANCED HAND IN HAND BESIDE THE CALM LAKE IN THE CLEAR MOONSHINE
ONE MUST DRESS ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER SAID SHE
THAT'S THE BISHOP OF ZEALAND WAS THE ANSWER
PRESENTS WERE THERE AND GOOD-HUMOR REIGNED
IT WAS AN EVENTFUL DAY FOR THEM
FOR HE IS A MAN OF SENSE AND NO ONE CAN BE MORE SUITABLE FOR HIS OFFICE THAN HE IS SO THE FAITHFUL OLD MINISTER WENT INTO THE HALL WHERE THE KNAVES WERE WORKING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AT THEIR EMPTY LOOMS
I AM FREEZING TO DEATH
IN THE GREATEST PERPLEXITY HE NOW CAME OUT OF THE LAST HEART IN THE ROW
SHE LOOKED ROUND HER THRICE BUT NO ONE FOLLOWED HER
OH VERY BADLY INDEED SHE REPLIED
IN THE FIELDS THE CORN WAS WAVING LIKE THE SEA
THE GIGANTIC PINE-FORESTS ON THE POINTED CRAGS SEEMED ALMOST LIKE LITTLE TUFTS OF HEATHER COLORED BY THE SURROUNDING CLOUDS
I WENT OUT FIRST IN THE EVENING
AND THE ELDERBUSH SENT FORTH A STRONG ODOUR IN THE SUN THAT WAS JUST ABOUT TO SET AND SHONE RIGHT IN THE OLD PEOPLE'S FACES
NOW WE ARE RIDING MILES OFF SAID THE BOY
BUT WE WILL RATHER PROCEED LIKE GOOD QUIET CITIZENS TO EAST STREET AND OBSERVE WHAT HAPPENED MEANWHILE TO THE BODY OF THE WATCHMAN
THEN WE WENT TO FRIEDERICKSBERG WHERE THE KING AND THE QUEEN WERE SAILING ABOUT IN THEIR SPLENDID BARGES BUT I HAD A DIFFERENT SORT OF SAILING TO THAT LATER
YOU WILL BURN A HOLE IN ME
HE HAD A NICE LITTLE BOW IN HIS HAND BUT IT WAS QUITE SPOILED BY THE RAIN AND THE TINTS OF HIS MANY-COLORED ARROWS RAN ONE INTO THE OTHER
AND THE COCK IS SCRAPING AWAY THE EARTH FOR THE HENS LOOK HOW HE STRUTS
AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD WHICH WAS MORE RED THAN WHITE AND HE BOWED TO THE GROUND AND ASKED THE OLD LADY WHETHER HE MIGHT DUST HER SHOES
DEAR LADY SAID THE COLLAR
BUT OUR LORD CAN SAID SHE
AT LAST HE RETURNED TO HIS PALACE QUITE CAST DOWN BECAUSE HE WISHED SO MUCH TO HAVE A REAL PRINCESS FOR HIS WIFE
HE UNDERSTOOD HIS COMPANION PERFECTLY
TO THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THIS WAS THE CUE
SIX EARTH-WORMS SHONE AS WELL AS THEY COULD
CUT THE AIR WITH THEIR SCISSORS
BUT THEN SHE WENT TO THE BALL AND BEGAN TO DANCE
TIS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE THOUGHT ON THOSE TIMES
NOR DID HE CARE TO GO EITHER TO THE THEATRE OR THE CHASE EXCEPT FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES THEN AFFORDED HIM FOR DISPLAYING HIS NEW CLOTHES
FOR IT GOT DARKER AND DARKER BUT HIS MOTHER HAD NO MONEY TO BUY A CANDLE
BUT THEY OF COURSE DID NOT ANSWER
BUT--IT IS NO PRIDE ON MY PART--AS A FREE MAN AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE NOT TO SPEAK OF MY POSITION IN LIFE MY EXCELLENT CIRCUMSTANCES--I CERTAINLY WISH THAT YOU WOULD SAY YOU TO ME IT IS THE CUSTOM IN DENMARK FOR INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES TO USE THE SECOND PERSON SINGULAR DU THOU WHEN SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER
ON THE VERY DAY HER MOTHER WAS BURIED KAREN RECEIVED THE RED SHOES AND WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME
BUT I WROTE DIRECT TO THE PERSONS THEMSELVES AND THERE WAS CONSTERNATION IN ALL THE TOWNS WHERE I CAME
THE SUN SHONE THE BIRDS SANG AND THE CHILDREN SANG TOO AND EACH HELD THE OTHER BY THE HAND
THE SNOW QUEEN KISSED KAY ONCE MORE AND THEN HE FORGOT LITTLE GERDA GRANDMOTHER AND ALL WHOM HE HAD LEFT AT HIS HOME
LOOK HOW CLEVER SAID KAY
I SING SO WELL SAID HE THAT SIXTEEN NATIVE GRASSHOPPERS WHO HAVE CHIRPED FROM INFANCY AND YET GOT NO HOUSE BUILT OF CARDS TO LIVE IN GREW THINNER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE FOR SHEER VEXATION WHEN THEY HEARD ME IT WAS THUS THAT THE FLEA AND THE GRASSHOPPER GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES AND THOUGHT THEY WERE QUITE GOOD ENOUGH TO MARRY A PRINCESS
I HAVE GOT SO MUCH BODY
I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO
IT IS A GREAT FAULT TO HAVE NO TASTE FOR WHAT IS WITTY OR AMUSING--COME LET US BE MEN AH YOU HAVE NO REMEMBRANCE OF LOVE FOR THE CHARMING MAIDENS THAT DANCED BENEATH THE OUTSPREAD TENTS BESIDE THE BRIGHT FRAGRANT FLOWERS
HE IS VERY UNFORTUNATE
AND THEN I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN
WHILE A PRETTY CANARY AS YELLOW AS GOLD THAT HAD LATELY BEEN BROUGHT FROM HIS SUNNY FRAGRANT HOME BEGAN TO SING ALOUD
LET US STROLL THITHER AND EXAMINE THE MATTER NEARER AND THE RICH PEOPLE DROVE OUT AND THE POOR WALKED BUT THE WAY SEEMED STRANGELY LONG TO THEM
AND AMONG THE OTHER BOUGHS GILDED APPLES AND WALNUTS WERE SUSPENDED LOOKING AS THOUGH THEY HAD GROWN THERE AND LITTLE BLUE AND WHITE TAPERS WERE PLACED AMONG THE LEAVES
FOR AS YET THEY HAD NONE OF THEM ANY HIGH OFFICE AND WERE ALL OF EQUAL RANK IN THE EYE OF GOD
HIGH TOWERS ROSE FROM THE CASTLE OF THE KING AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF MANY CANDLES STREAMED FROM ALL THE WINDOWS
AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE-SIZED COMRADES PINES AS WELL AS FIRS
I WILL NEVER CONFESS THAT I COULD NOT SEE THE STUFF WELL SIR MINISTER SAID ONE OF THE KNAVES STILL PRETENDING TO WORK
AND NOW THE RAIN POURS RIGHT DOWN THE STALK
TIS ONLY THE UNFORTUNATE TALES OF EVERY-DAY LIFE THAT I CANNOT BEAR--WE HAVE ENOUGH AND MORE THAN ENOUGH SUCH IN REALITY TALES OF EVERY-DAY LIFE SAID OUR BACHELOR INQUIRINGLY
THE OLD MAN TOLD HIS WIFE THE STORY OF OLD NANNY AS IT HAD BEEN TOLD HIM WHEN A BOY
AND THE RAIN BEAT ON THE DOCK-LEAVES TO MAKE DRUM-MUSIC FOR THEIR SAKE AND THE SUN SHONE IN ORDER TO GIVE THE BURDOCK FOREST A COLOR FOR THEIR SAKES
THE CHURCH-BELLS RANG AND THE CHILDREN RECOGNISED THE HIGH TOWERS AND THE LARGE TOWN
SO THE PRINCESS WAS TO HAVE THE ROSE AND THE NIGHTINGALE
BUT TELL ME NOW ONCE MORE ALL ABOUT LITTLE KAY
FLY AWAY
AND IT IS ABOUT ONE OF THESE COLLARS THAT WE ARE NOW TO HEAR A STORY
AND HE WHO HAD BEEN THUS CALLED BACK AGAIN TO LIFE AROSE FROM HIS DREAD COUCH IN ALL THE VIGOR OF YOUTH
BUT IN THIS WORLD MERIT SELDOM MEETS ITS REWARD
BUT KAREN HERSELF WAS CLEANLY AND NICELY DRESSED
THEN THE QUESTION IS IF WE CAN TRUST OURSELVES TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF EVERY UNBECOMING WORD IN OUR HEART AND ON OUR LIPS
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING AND HOW YOU MANAGED TO CATCH HIM AND GERDA AND KAY BOTH TOLD THEIR STORY
YOU ARE SO CLEVER SAID THE REINDEER
AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID WELL TO BE SURE
THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN
YOU LOOK SO UGLY
I WILL GO TO A WATERING-PLACE--MY BEARD DOES NOT GROW OUT AS IT OUGHT--THAT IS ALSO A SICKNESS--AND ONE MUST HAVE A BEARD
YES IT WAS IN TRUTH LIVELY ENOUGH DOWN IN THE STREET
THE VIOLETS EXHALED THEIR SWEET BREATH WHILST I PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES COVERED WITH FANTASTIC FROST-WORK THE COPPER COIN I HAD HEATED ON THE STOVE AND SO MADE PEEP-HOLES
THERE STOOD POOR GERDA NOW WITHOUT SHOES OR GLOVES IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF DREADFUL ICY FINLAND
I WILL ENJOY TO THE FULL ALL MY SPLENDOR
PRESENTLY BLACK NIGHT OVERSHADOWED OUR ENTHUSIAST WHO HAD SO ENTIRELY MISSED HIS PART OF COPYING-CLERK AT A POLICE-OFFICE
IT HAPPENED THAT WHERE THE PRINCE'S FATHER LAY BURIED THERE GREW A ROSE TREE--A MOST BEAUTIFUL ROSE TREE WHICH BLOSSOMED ONLY ONCE IN EVERY FIVE YEARS AND EVEN THEN BORE ONLY ONE FLOWER BUT THAT WAS A ROSE
EVERYTHING THAT WAS PECULIAR AND DISPLEASING IN THEM--THAT KAY KNEW HOW TO IMITATE
THE TOWN TAKES ITS NAME FROM KING HROAR AND THE MANY FOUNTAINS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR WITH FIR TREES ONE CAN ALWAYS TELL BY THE SHOOTS HOW MANY YEARS OLD THEY ARE
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I AM A SIMPLETON
THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER
NEVERTHELESS THEY ALL EXCLAIMED OH HOW BEAUTIFUL AND ADVISED HIS MAJESTY TO HAVE SOME NEW CLOTHES MADE FROM THIS SPLENDID MATERIAL FOR THE APPROACHING PROCESSION
DON'T STAY TALKING BUT HASTEN BACK AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND NOW THE FINLAND WOMAN PLACED LITTLE GERDA ON THE REINDEER'S BACK AND OFF HE RAN WITH ALL IMAGINABLE SPEED
I WILL SING OF THY DARK-GREEN BOWERS OF THE CALM BAYS WHERE THE PENDENT BOUGHS KISS THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
HE THEN CRIED AS LOUD AS HE COULD BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM
WE ARE RIDING AWAY TO THE CASTLE WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR AND ON THEY RODE ROUND THE GRASS-PLOT
THOU SAY'ST THAT THOU ART SO UNHAPPY AND NOW THOU WILT MAKE ANOTHER MOTHER EQUALLY UNHAPPY ANOTHER MOTHER SAID THE POOR WOMAN AND DIRECTLY LET GO HER HOLD OF BOTH THE FLOWERS
OH CRIED THE WOMAN AT THE SAME MOMENT
BUT IN JEST IT SIGNIFIES EXCESSIVELY FINE WHICH AROSE FROM AN ANECDOTE OF NYBODER IN COPENHAGEN THE SEAMEN'S QUARTER A SAILOR'S WIFE WHO WAS ALWAYS PROUD AND FINE IN HER WAY CAME TO HER NEIGHBOR AND COMPLAINED THAT SHE HAD GOT A SPLINTER IN HER FINGER
DU LIEBER AUGUSTIN ALLES IST WEG WEG WEG AH
BUT WE MIGHT GIVE THE ANTS A COMMISSION TO LOOK OUT FOR US
THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SAID SOMETHING CLEVER
BUT HE LEAPED INTO THE KING'S FACE WHO SAID THAT WAS ILL-MANNERED
FOR THEN--OH THEN--THEY COULD CHATTER ENOUGH
AND OFF HE WAS IN A MOMENT
HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE OUR EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES
BUT COME AND TELL ME WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU CAME HERE SAID SHE
BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN
IT RELATED THE MYTHUS OF ITS BIRTH TOLD OF THE POWER OF THE SUN-LIGHT THAT SPREAD OUT ITS DELICATE LEAVES AND FORCED THEM TO IMPREGNATE THE AIR WITH THEIR INCENSE--AND THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE MANIFOLD STRUGGLES OF LIFE WHICH IN LIKE MANNER AWAKEN THE BUDDING FLOWERS OF FEELING IN OUR BOSOM
THEY INHABITED TWO GARRETS
THE HAPPY FAMILY REALLY THE LARGEST GREEN LEAF IN THIS COUNTRY IS A DOCK-LEAF
BUT THE OLD PEOPLE HAD FORGOTTEN IT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ABLE TO REMEMBER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED MANY YEARS AGO
WHAT BECAME OF THEM
I ALSO WISHED TO SEE THIS LAND AGAIN--FOR YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOVE OUR NATIVE LAND
THERE HE SAT QUITE BENUMBED AND MOTIONLESS
IT WAS A SPLENDID ELDERBUSH A WHOLE TREE
HER EYES WERE SO LARGE AND BLUE THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT THEM
AND WHEN IN FOREIGN LANDS HE OPENED THE BOOK IT WAS ALWAYS AT THE PLACE WHERE THE KEEPSAKE-FLOWER LAY
LITTLE BELLS WERE HUNG ALL ROUND IT
COUNCILLOR KNAP DEEPLY OCCUPIED WITH THE TIMES OF KING HANS INTENDED TO GO HOME AND MALICIOUS FATE MANAGED MATTERS SO THAT HIS FEET INSTEAD OF FINDING THEIR WAY TO HIS OWN GALOSHES SLIPPED INTO THOSE OF FORTUNE
HOW THE TREE QUIVERED
THEY ALL HAD MUCH TO SAY BUT THE COLLAR THE MOST
HOWEVER NO ONE SHALL KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND ACCORDINGLY HE PRAISED THE STUFF HE COULD NOT SEE AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED WITH BOTH COLORS AND PATTERNS
OUT THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SNOW THERE SAT A WOMAN IN LONG BLACK CLOTHES
AND THEY MUST SHUT HIM IN THE EMPTY CAGE THAT WAS STANDING IN THE WINDOW
DO NOT FORGET MY SLEDGE IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF
WE PEEPED THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND SAW THEM PLANTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WARM ROOM AND ORNAMENTED WITH THE MOST SPLENDID THINGS WITH GILDED APPLES WITH GINGERBREAD WITH TOYS AND MANY HUNDRED LIGHTS AND THEN ASKED THE FIR TREE TREMBLING IN EVERY BOUGH
BUT WHEN THE WATCHMAN GAVE NO REPLY THE MERRY ROYSTERER WHO WAS NOW RETURNING HOME FROM A NOISY DRINKING BOUT TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO TRY WHAT A TWEAK OF THE NOSE WOULD DO ON WHICH THE SUPPOSED SLEEPER LOST HIS BALANCE THE BODY LAY MOTIONLESS STRETCHED OUT ON THE PAVEMENT
AND ALL WERE ANXIOUS TO LEARN HOW WISE OR HOW IGNORANT THEIR NEIGHBORS MIGHT PROVE TO BE
IT THEN SEEMED TO HIM AS IF WHAT HE KNEW WAS NOT ENOUGH AND HE LOOKED UPWARDS IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM
THEN PERHAPS YOU MAY HEAR A FAIRY TALE IF I HAD BUT SOMETHING NEW TO TELL SAID THE OLD MAN
AND NOW WE SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
ALL IS GONE GONE GONE BUT WHAT WAS STILL MORE CURIOUS WHOEVER HELD HIS FINGER IN THE SMOKE OF THE KITCHEN-POT IMMEDIATELY SMELT ALL THE DISHES THAT WERE COOKING ON EVERY HEARTH IN THE CITY--THIS YOU SEE WAS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE ROSE
THE OLDER PERSONS FOLLOWED QUIETLY
WHEN ONE IS AS HANDSOME AS YOU SAID THE COLLAR THAT IS OCCASION ENOUGH DON'T COME SO NEAR ME I BEG OF YOU SAID THE GARTER
SEE HOW NICELY IT SITS BETWEEN THE FLOWERS
THIS STUFF MUST BE WOVEN FOR ME IMMEDIATELY AND HE CAUSED LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO BE GIVEN TO BOTH THE WEAVERS IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT BEGIN THEIR WORK DIRECTLY
AND THE PEOPLE DELAY TAKING DOWN THEIR SIGN IN HOPES OF A LATE VISITOR OR TWO A FEW PERSONS IN THE COSTUME OF THE TIME OF KING HANS PASSED QUICKLY BY HIM
HE WAS SOON ABLE TO IMITATE THE GAIT AND MANNER OF EVERYONE IN THE STREET
IT WAS THERE TIED TO ONE OF THE WHITE CHICKENS WHO FLEW ALONG WITH IT ON HIS BACK BEHIND THE LARGE SLEDGE
THE SWING MOVES
BUT THEY FLEW ALONG THE BANK AND SANG AS IF TO COMFORT HER HERE WE ARE
FAREWELL THEY ALL SAID
SOMETHING CAME HERE AND SOMETHING CAME THERE
HOWEVER SHE DREW ON WOODEN SLIPPERS FIRST
C
THEY HELD EACH OTHER BY THE HAND AS THE OLD GRAND-FATHER AND GRAND-MOTHER YONDER IN THE NEW BOOTHS DID AND THEY TALKED EXACTLY LIKE THEM OF OLD TIMES AND OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR WEDDING
IT LIES HIGH UPON THE HILL BETWEEN THE LARGE OAK-TREES ONE OF WHICH IS HALF DECAYED
THE FREED SOUL SOARS UPWARDS ON THE WINGS OF ELECTRICITY
AND IT WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF HIS PRAYER-BOOK
FIE NAUGHTY CUPID
HE WAS NOT CALLED AWAY
ALL THE BOYS KNEW WAS THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM TIE HIS SLEDGE TO ANOTHER LARGE AND SPLENDID ONE WHICH DROVE DOWN THE STREET AND OUT OF THE TOWN
SO SHE BROUGHT HIM A PITCHER OF WATER WHICH TASTED CERTAINLY PRETTY STRONG OF THE SEA ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN FETCHED FROM THE WELL
THE POOR OLD MINISTER LOOKED AND LOOKED HE COULD NOT DISCOVER ANYTHING ON THE LOOMS FOR A VERY GOOD REASON VIZ
NOTHING BUT WRETCHED HUTS CAN I SEE ANYWHERE
NOW THEY WERE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PRINCESS REIGNED WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME
WHILE WILD-DRONE FLOWERS AND BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES WERE CREEPING IN THE HEDGES
WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT COMING BY A PATH TO THE RIGHT APPEARED IN HIS WOODEN SHOES AND JACKET THE POOR BOY WHO HAD BEEN CONFIRMED WITH HIM
THAT IS OUR WAY OF SINGING THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE AND GERDA WENT TO THE RANUNCULUSES THAT LOOKED FORTH FROM AMONG THE SHINING GREEN LEAVES
I WILL PUT THEM HERE BY THE DOOR
YOU ARE A LITTLE BRIGHT SUN SAID GERDA
AT LAST SPRING CAME WITH ITS WARM SUNSHINE
PAY ATTENTION
I WILL SEND MY FAITHFUL OLD MINISTER TO THE WEAVERS SAID THE EMPEROR AT LAST AFTER SOME DELIBERATION HE WILL BE BEST ABLE TO SEE HOW THE CLOTH LOOKS
BY YOUR LEAVE SAID THE COUNCILLOR TO THE HOSTESS WHO CAME BUSTLING TOWARDS HIM
FOR HIS NAME WAS RENOWNED FAR AND WIDE
HE HAS NEITHER AN INFIRM MOTHER NOR A WHOLE TROOP OF EVERLASTINGLY HUNGRY CHILDREN TO TORMENT HIM
ANDERSEN CALLED MY AUNT'S SPECTACLES
SHE ALWAYS ATTENDS TO HER OWN SERIOUS BUSINESS HERSELF AS THEN SHE IS SURE OF HAVING IT DONE PROPERLY
LITTLE GERDA WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND BEGAN TO CRY
THERE THAT IS MY LITTLE STORY SAID THE RANUNCULUS
WHAT OF ASKED THE NEIGHBOR'S WIFE
I SHOULD LIKE SOME DAY JUST FOR A TRIAL TO TAKE SUCH NATURE UPON ME AND BE A POET MYSELF
BUT THE REINDEER BEGGED SO HARD FOR LITTLE GERDA AND GERDA LOOKED SO IMPLORINGLY WITH TEARFUL EYES AT THE FINLAND WOMAN THAT SHE WINKED AND DREW THE REINDEER ASIDE INTO A CORNER WHERE THEY WHISPERED TOGETHER WHILE THE ANIMAL GOT SOME FRESH ICE PUT ON HIS HEAD
BUT IT IS A CHAIN FRIEND WHICH ENSURES YOU THE BLESSED BREAD OF EXISTENCE ANSWERED THE POET
EVERYTHING OUT-OF-DOORS WAS COVERED WITH ICE AND SNOW AND THE WIND BLEW SO THAT IT CUT THE FACE
AND AWAY HE RAN
AND LOOK THIS ONE IS QUITE CROOKED
BUT THEN YOU MUST ALSO PROMISE ME THAT WHEREVER YOU MAY MEET ME YOU WILL NEVER SAY TO ANYONE HERE IN THE TOWN THAT I HAVE BEEN YOUR SHADOW
I EITHER BEHOLD A FATA MORGANA OR I AM REGULARLY TIPSY WHIMPERED OUT THE COUNCILLOR
AT NIGHT THE BOXES AND OTHER EFFECTS OF THE PASSENGERS WERE PLACED AGAINST THE RICKETY DOORS
I WILL NOW CONFER A BENEFIT ON HIM AND SHE TOOK THE GALOSHES FROM HIS FEET
AND RABBITS AND HARES WERE BEING ROASTED ON A SPIT
FOR THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE ALL SORTS OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS WERE TO BE FOUND
HE HAD A LITTLE KNAPSACK AT HIS BACK SAID THE RAVEN
THERE STOOD BEAUTIFUL PALM-TREES OAKS AND PLANTAINS
THERE WERE THREE PERSONS WHO ASSERTED THEY HAD PENETRATED TO THE END OF THE FOREST AND THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS HEARD THE WONDERFUL SOUNDS OF THE BELL BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO THEM AS IF IT HAD COME FROM THE TOWN
WHAT'S YOUR NAME MY NAME IS CUPID ANSWERED THE BOY
VAUDEVILLE WITH NEW SONGS TO THE MOST FAVORITE AIRS THE DEUCE
KRIBLEDY KRABLEDY--PLUMP DOWN FELL SOMEBODY
HUMPY-DUMPY CRIED THE OTHERS
NO PLACE CAN BE BETTER THAN OURS AND I HAVE NOTHING TO WISH FOR YES SAID THE DAME
AND AFTERWARDS IN ANOTHER DIRECTION IF THAT DID NOT PLEASE HER
MANY REMEMBRANCES FROM CORSOR THAT IS A TOWN THAT IS JUST RISING INTO IMPORTANCE
HE SAT LIFELESS ON THE STEPS
IN THE SPRING THEY PULLED THE HOUSE DOWN FOR AS PEOPLE SAID IT WAS A RUIN
YES SAID THE THORN-BUSH
FOR AS YET NO LAWFUL OWNER HAD APPEARED TO CLAIM THEM
I WILL THEREFORE DO SOMETHING PARTICULAR FOR THEE
DID ALL THE GODS OF THE OLDEN TIMES PASS THROUGH THE LARGE SALOONS
DEAR ME HOW LONG I HAVE STAID SAID GERDA
I AM A KJOGER HEN SAID SHE AND THEN SHE RELATED HOW MANY INHABITANTS THERE WERE THERE AND ABOUT THE BATTLE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND WHICH AFTER ALL WAS HARDLY WORTH TALKING ABOUT
I AM QUITE DESPERATE FOR I TAKE IT SO MUCH TO HEART BUT I DON'T SAID THE SHADOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNCILLOR IT WAS LATE
THE GOOD FOLKS COME PROBABLY FROM A MASQUERADE SUDDENLY WAS HEARD THE SOUND OF DRUMS AND FIFES
AND WHO WAS SO WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE THAT IT WAS QUITE AMUSING TO SEE HER
OH HE IS A HUNDRED TIMES HAPPIER THAN I IN THE SAME MOMENT THE WATCHMAN WAS AGAIN WATCHMAN
THESE YOUNG TREES AND THEY WERE ALWAYS THE FINEST LOOKING RETAINED THEIR BRANCHES
THE FINE SPLINTERS STILL FLEW ABOUT IN THE AIR
EVEN THE POOREST CHILD SAID IT IS REALLY DELIGHTFUL HERE IN WINTER YES IT WAS DELIGHTFUL
WHAT WEATHER IT WAS AND WHAT A STATE THE STREET WAS IN AND THEN WE MARRIED SAID HE
THE CONGREGATION SAT IN CUSHIONED SEATS AND SANG OUT OF THEIR PRAYER-BOOKS
ONLY JUST TELL ME WHERE THE BRIDGE IS SAID HE
GRACIOUS HEAVEN SAID HE
IT IS REALLY DREADFUL GROANED HE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY
IT HAD PATENT LEATHER BOOTS AND A HAT THAT COULD BE FOLDED TOGETHER SO THAT IT WAS BARE CROWN AND BRIM
THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT DAY ALSO
THE OLD MAN NOW WENT INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO FETCH PRESERVES APPLES AND NUTS--YES IT WAS DELIGHTFUL OVER THERE IN THE OLD HOUSE
EXACTLY AS THE STREET HAD APPEARED BEFORE WITH STEPS PROJECTING WINDOWS AND POINTED GABLES
HERE ARE TWO LOAVES AND A HAM FOR YOU SO THAT YOU WON'T STARVE THE BREAD AND THE MEAT WERE FASTENED TO THE REINDEER'S BACK
I HAVE NOW BECOME AS HAPPY AND MIGHTY AS ANYONE CAN BE
NO--I AM FAR FROM WELL SIGHED HE
NEXT MORNING THE LEARNED MAN WENT OUT TO DRINK COFFEE AND READ THE NEWSPAPERS
SOME HUNDRED PACES FROM IT LIES THE MANOR-HOUSE NY SOE WHERE THORWALDSEN THE FAMED SCULPTOR GENERALLY SOJOURNED DURING HIS STAY IN DENMARK AND WHERE HE CALLED MANY OF HIS IMMORTAL WORKS INTO EXISTENCE
ONE DAY WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE HAT OF THE OLD WOMAN PAINTED WITH FLOWERS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEM ALL SEEMED TO HER TO BE A ROSE
THERE WAS NO LIGHT
I CAN BEAR IT NO LONGER YOU MUST NOT LET IT GRIEVE YOU SO MUCH SAID THE LITTLE BOY
BUT THE BURDOCKS WERE NOT EXTINCT THEY GREW AND GREW ALL OVER THE WALKS AND ALL THE BEDS
BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE
AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA
I HAD BOTH A BOOT-JACK AND A HAIR-COMB WHICH I NEVER USED
AND HE GLANCED THE WHILE FROM TIME TO TIME INTO THE GEOGRAPHY-BOOK THAT LAY OPEN BEFORE HIM
BUT NOW THE REST OF THE BODY WAS TO BE GOT THROUGH
IT WAS QUITE GREEN LIKE THE LEAVES OF THE ELDER AND WAS TRIMMED WITH LARGE WHITE ELDER-FLOWERS
AND NOW SHE SLEPT BUT ONLY FOR A MINUTE WHEN SHE STARTED UP AND TREMBLED WITH COLD
AND IF THEY LIVED HONESTLY AND DECENTLY AND INCREASED AND MULTIPLIED THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN WOULD ONCE IN THE COURSE OF TIME COME TO THE MANOR-HOUSE BE BOILED BLACK AND LAID ON SILVER DISHES
BUT WHEN SHE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY THE BELLS TINKLED SO PRETTILY ACH
BUT THEY MAY STILL COME--THEY MAY STILL COME
THE LEARNED MAN HEARD NOTHING OF ALL THIS--FOR THEY HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF LIFE
DON'T COME SO NEAR ME SAID THE GARTER
THAT PLACE WHERE ONE ENTERS LEAN AND COMES OUT AGAIN FAT AND PORTLY I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
BUT HER HOT TEARS FELL JUST WHERE A ROSE-BUSH HAD SUNK
IT WAS AGAIN THAT SUNDAY MORNING
THE CANDLES WERE NOW LIGHTED--WHAT BRIGHTNESS
THE LEARNED MAN WAS NOT AT ALL IN THE MOST ENVIABLE STATE
THE GRASSHOPPER SAT WITHOUT ON A GREEN BANK AND REFLECTED ON WORLDLY THINGS
AND IF THEY HAD BEEN PLACED IN RANK AND FILE AND COPIED BY SOME SKILFUL PAINTER'S HAND ONE WOULD WITHOUT DOUBT HAVE EXCLAIMED INVOLUNTARILY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ARABESQUE THIS RELATES TO A BOOK PUBLISHED SOME YEARS AGO IN GERMANY AND SAID TO BE BY HERSCHEL WHICH CONTAINED A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOON AND ITS INHABITANTS WRITTEN WITH SUCH A SEMBLANCE OF TRUTH THAT MANY WERE DECEIVED BY THE IMPOSTURE
IN THE TEA-POT SAID HIS MOTHER
HE BEHELD HIMSELF AND WISHED HE HAD REMAINED IN HIS DARK CORNER IN THE LOFT
GERDA KISSED THE ROSES THOUGHT OF HER OWN DEAR ROSES AT HOME AND WITH THEM OF LITTLE KAY
HAVE I ANYTHING TO PAY TO IT OR YOU
HERE YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU PLEASE TO WANT AH
SO FROM THIS THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE MANOR-HOUSE HAD FALLEN TO RUINS AND THAT ALL THE MEN IN THE WORLD WERE EXTINCT
SOLDIERS LIKE THE KNAVE OF CLUBS AND CITIZENS WITH WAVING FLAGS
BUT WHERE WERE THE HACKNEY-COACHES
IT BEGAN TO SNOW A COLD WIND BLEW AND ROARED AS THOUGH IT WERE SEEKING A BRIDE
AND THEN THE PROJECTING WINDOWS STAND SO FAR OUT THAT NO ONE CAN SEE FROM OUR WINDOWS WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE VERY SMALLEST BIT HAD THE SAME POWER WHICH THE WHOLE MIRROR HAD POSSESSED
ALL OUR FOREFATHERS HAVE BEEN TREATED SO
NEXT NIGHT TWO MORE MICE CAME AND ON SUNDAY TWO RATS EVEN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WALL HUNG A PICTURE REPRESENTING A BEAUTIFUL LADY SO YOUNG SO GLAD BUT DRESSED QUITE AS IN FORMER TIMES WITH CLOTHES THAT STOOD QUITE STIFF AND WITH POWDER IN HER HAIR
LITTLE KAY WAS QUITE BLUE YES NEARLY BLACK WITH COLD
AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE BUSH WITH THE RED BERRIES THEY FOUND THE REINDEER WAITING FOR THEM
AND THEY PROMISED TO DO HIM GOOD SERVICE IN THE WET
MY SLEDGE
BUT SHE WAS RATHER AFRAID OF THE STRANGE OLD WOMAN
IN REALITY THE BELL DOES NOT EXIST
NEVER HAVE I THOUGHT OR FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE
SHE HAD BEEN BITTEN IN THE EAR BY HER OWN LITTLE DAUGHTER WHO HUNG AT HER BACK
HE WAS IN AN INTERMEDIATE STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING
THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY-CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE-BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS--AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
SUCH A PAIR OF SHOES MUST BE VERY WARM AND COMFORTABLE SAID HE
THE COUNCILLOR STOOD STILL AND WATCHED A MOST STRANGE PROCESSION PASS BY
IT WAS WASHED IN THE TEAPOT AND DRIED ON THE ROOF
HIS EYES SHONE LIKE YOURS HE HAD BEAUTIFUL LONG HAIR BUT HIS CLOTHES WERE VERY SHABBY THAT WAS KAY CRIED GERDA WITH A VOICE OF DELIGHT
I SHALL FIND HIM SAID THE OLD MAN
HE THEREFORE PUT HIS GEOGRAPHY-BOOK UNDER HIS PILLOW BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING TO DO WHEN ONE WANTS TO LEARN ONE'S LESSON
FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS
COME IN SAID HE
HIS EYES WERE LIKE TWO BRIGHT STARS
BESIDES HE THOUGHT THAT THE BELL MUST BE LOOKED FOR TO THE RIGHT
THE WHOLE SUIT IS AS LIGHT AS A COBWEB
THAT'S GLORIOUS FUN SAID THE SPRITE
FIRST THEY SHONE LIKE SILVER THEN LIKE GOLD
AND SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF THEM AS THE CLERGYMAN LAID HIS HAND UPON HER HEAD AND SPOKE OF THE HOLY BAPTISM OF THE COVENANT WITH GOD AND HOW SHE SHOULD BE NOW A MATURED CHRISTIAN
YET HOW WOULD THEY BE
THERE WERE ONCE UPON A TIME THREE SISTERS QUITE TRANSPARENT AND VERY BEAUTIFUL
AND NOW STOOD THERE AN OLD PEASANT-WOMAN WHO CAME FROM SOROE WHERE GRASS GROWS IN THE MARKET-PLACE
SHE ALWAYS HAD A FEW TWIGS OR GREEN SHOOTS IN WATER--LET THE WINTER RAGE WITHOUT AS IT MIGHT
IT SHOOTS WELL I CAN ASSURE YOU
BUT I DID NOT LIKE IT THEN
FOR HER OLD GRANDMOTHER THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW NO MORE HAD TOLD HER THAT WHEN A STAR FALLS A SOUL ASCENDS TO GOD
HOW IT REMINDS ME OF THE VIOLETS IN THE GARDEN OF MY AUNT MAGDALENA
NOW YOU SHALL SEE HOW WELL WE AGREE TOGETHER
AND THEY WERE VERY HAPPY AND THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS HAPPY
DO YOU NOT SEE THAT PERSON WHO ALWAYS GOES WITH ME
HERE SHE KNEW DWELT THE EXECUTIONER
OH IT IS DRY AGAIN AND IS NOT HURT AT ALL
IT WAS LIKE A HORRID GUST COMING FROM A BURIAL-VAULT ON A WARM SUMMER'S DAY--BUT ALL AROUND THE MOUNTAINS RETAINED THAT WONDERFUL GREEN TONE WHICH WE SEE IN SOME OLD PICTURES AND WHICH SHOULD WE NOT HAVE SEEN A SIMILAR PLAY OF COLOR IN THE SOUTH WE DECLARE AT ONCE TO BE UNNATURAL
THERE WAS SO MUCH OF IT THAT EACH ARTICLE STOOD IN THE OTHER'S WAY TO GET A LOOK AT THE LITTLE BOY
THEN WOULD THE BIRDS BUILD NESTS AMONG MY BRANCHES
WHAT DEBT IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT
THOSE WHO HAVE NOT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS WILL BE WETTED TO THE SKIN SAID THE GOOD OLD POET
I LAUGHED AND WEPT
IT GREW THERE IN THE CORNER OF A LITTLE MISERABLE COURT-YARD
HOW NICE SHE WILL BE AND THEN SHE DREW OUT A KNIFE THE BLADE OF WHICH SHONE SO THAT IT WAS QUITE DREADFUL TO BEHOLD
WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD GOT MY HEAD THROUGH SAID HE INVOLUNTARILY
IT WAS STARCHED HUNG OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR IN THE SUNSHINE AND WAS THEN LAID ON THE IRONING-BLANKET
DO YOU CHOOSE TO BE QUIET SAID THE ROBBER MAIDEN
THOU ART MORE THAN NICE THOU ART BEAUTIFUL NOW THE QUEEN ONCE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE LAND AND SHE HAD HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WITH HER
NO ONE EVEN DREAMED OF THE SPLENDOR IN WHICH WITH HER GRANDMOTHER SHE HAD ENTERED ON THE JOYS OF A NEW YEAR
SHE FELL ASLEEP AND HAD AS PLEASANT DREAMS AS EVER A QUEEN ON HER WEDDING-DAY
AND WITHOUT MORE ADO SHE CUT HIM AND THEN HE WAS CONDEMNED
I CANNOT COME IN FOR I AM FORCED TO DANCE AND THE EXECUTIONER SAID THOU DOST NOT KNOW WHO I AM I FANCY
BUT THE TRANSITION FROM A COMMONPLACE NATURE TO ONE THAT IS RICHLY ENDOWED DEMANDS ALWAYS A MORE OR LESS BREAKNECK LEAP OVER A CERTAIN ABYSS WHICH YAWNS THREATENINGLY BELOW
CAW--CAW SAID HE
OH HOW I LONG HOW I SUFFER
THE FALSE COLLAR THERE WAS ONCE A FINE GENTLEMAN ALL OF WHOSE MOVEABLES WERE A BOOT-JACK AND A HAIR-COMB
IT WILL BE A GREAT PLEASURE FOR ME TO HAVE YOU WITH ME
LITTLE GERDA REPEATED THE LORD'S PRAYER
HE FELT UNWORTHY TO TREAD THE NEIGHBORING SANCTUARY WHICH A POOR GARRET WITH A SICK BED-RID MOTHER REVEALED
SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN
AND THEY INVITED THE WHOLE WORLD AND EVERYBODY ELSE BESIDES WHO CHOSE TO COME TO SEE THE FESTIVAL
IT SEEMED TO HIM JUST AS IF ONE TURNED OVER A LEAF IN A BOOK
NOW DRINK YOUR TEA SAID THE BOY'S MOTHER
AND WHEN THE POT WAS BOILING THESE BELLS TINKLED IN THE MOST CHARMING MANNER AND PLAYED THE OLD MELODY ACH
OR THE BURDOCKS HAVE GROWN UP OVER IT SO THAT THEY CANNOT COME OUT
SO MUCH THEN FOR THE INTRODUCTION
THE ROOM HAD SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THE CLAY-FLOORED HALLS IN HOLSTEIN
IT WAS A COARSE WOOD-CUT REPRESENTING A SPLENDID METEOR AS SEEN IN THE TOWN OF COLOGNE WHICH WAS TO BE READ BELOW IN BRIGHT LETTERS
THE FLAMES RISE AROUND HER AND HER DEAD HUSBAND BUT THE HINDOO WOMAN THINKS ON THE LIVING ONE IN THE SURROUNDING CIRCLE
AND ALL THE TREES WERE COVERED WITH HOAR-FROST
THE FLAKES RAN ALONG THE GROUND AND THE NEARER THEY CAME THE LARGER THEY GREW
GROWN-UP AND YET CHILDREN
OH HE IS A NAUGHTY BOY THAT CUPID
AND THE OLD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID A-HEM
I REALLY BELIEVE I AM AS GOOD AS MANY A ONE WHO SITS IN THE CHURCH AND HOLDS HER HEAD SO HIGH AND AWAY SHE WENT BOLDLY
THEY WERE VERY CLUMSY BUT IT WAS A KIND THOUGHT
TUK RAN QUICKLY TO THE WINDOW AND READ SO EAGERLY THAT HE PRETTY NEARLY READ HIS EYES OUT
IF SHE CANNOT GET TO THE SNOW QUEEN BY HERSELF AND RID LITTLE KAY OF THE GLASS WE CANNOT HELP HER
AT THE END OF A YEAR HE HAD SHOT UP A GOOD DEAL AND AFTER ANOTHER YEAR HE WAS ANOTHER LONG BIT TALLER
ALAS
NAY
FOR HE HAD NEITHER WIFE NOR CHILDREN--BUT HE LIKED CHILDREN VERY MUCH AND KNEW SO MANY FAIRY TALES THAT IT WAS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
ARE THERE NO ROSES HERE AND SHE RAN ABOUT AMONGST THE FLOWERBEDS AND LOOKED AND LOOKED BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE TO BE FOUND
AND WHY I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ARE THE POLICE NEVER TO BE WRONG
FOR WHEN HE WENT AWAY HE TOOK HIS SLEDGE WITH HIM THAT MAY BE SAID THE RAVEN
IN ROESKILDE TOO THE MEMBERS OF THE DANISH DIET ASSEMBLE
YOU VANISH LIKE THE WARM STOVE LIKE THE DELICIOUS ROAST GOOSE AND LIKE THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMAS TREE AND SHE RUBBED THE WHOLE BUNDLE OF MATCHES QUICKLY AGAINST THE WALL FOR SHE WANTED TO BE QUITE SURE OF KEEPING HER GRANDMOTHER NEAR HER
AND AS SOON AS THE SUN APPEARED THE WHOLE TOWN AND THE KING'S PALACE CRUMBLED TOGETHER AND ONE TOWER AFTER THE OTHER
BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND
I BECAME A MAN
ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHOSE HEAD IN A PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY MIGHT BE SAID TO BE OF THE THICKEST HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING
AND IT HAPPENED THAT IT CAME TO BE WASHED IN COMPANY WITH A GARTER
THAT WAS A RELIEF SAID THE NEIGHBORING HOUSES
HER HEART WAS SO FULL OF SUNSHINE PEACE AND JOY THAT IT BROKE
FOR THAT SEEMED TO HIM OF MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE
NOW THEN THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT I AM DREAMING
SOME ONE OF THE WORTHY BURGHERS NOW SPOKE OF THE DREADFUL PESTILENCE THAT HAD RAGED IN THE COUNTRY A FEW YEARS BACK MEANING THAT OF 1484
YOU ARE OF A POETICAL NATURE AS IT IS CALLED--I ON THE CONTRARY POSSESS PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE AND INEXHAUSTIBLE WIT
I AM SPEAKING ABOUT MY STORY--ABOUT MY DREAM ANSWERED THE CONVOLVULUS
SHE ROSE AND LOOKED FOR MANY HOURS AT THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN BANKS
SO NOW THE EMPEROR WALKED UNDER HIS HIGH CANOPY IN THE MIDST OF THE PROCESSION THROUGH THE STREETS OF HIS CAPITAL
THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE PROCESSION WAS A PRIEST
IT WILL SOON BECOME LIKE ICE
I AM GOING NOW TO WARM LANDS SAID THE SNOW QUEEN
BUT THE WHOLE WAS ONLY A DREAM AND THEREFORE IT ALL VANISHED AS SOON AS SHE AWOKE
AND THEY RUSHED FORWARD SEIZED THE HORSES KNOCKED DOWN THE LITTLE POSTILION THE COACHMAN AND THE SERVANTS AND PULLED LITTLE GERDA OUT OF THE CARRIAGE
ONE EVENING THE STRANGER SAT OUT ON THE BALCONY
AND THE MORE HE RELATED THE MORE HE REMEMBERED HIMSELF
IS NOT THE WORK ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT SAID THE TWO OFFICERS OF THE CROWN ALREADY MENTIONED
SIT DOWN OLD FRIEND AND TELL ME A LITTLE HOW IT HAS GONE WITH THEE AND WHAT THOU HAST SEEN AT OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S THERE--IN THE WARM LANDS YES I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SAID THE SHADOW AND SAT DOWN
HE DAUBED HIS FACE OVER BROWN AND BLACK
THEN PERHAPS BY USING THEM CIRCUMSPECTLY ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN MERELY TO SEE WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR
AND BESIDES I LEARNED TO KNOW MY INWARD NATURE MY INNATE QUALITIES THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH POESY
STIFF AND STARK SAT THE CHILD THERE WITH HER MATCHES OF WHICH ONE BUNDLE HAD BEEN BURNT
A FAR MORE CORRECT IMAGINATION THAN THAT OF THE PSEUDO-HERSCHEL HAD CREATED THEM
IT GROWS MUCH WORSE
THE CHILD GREW UP TO WOMANHOOD FULL SOON
HOW ALL HIS FINGERS GLITTERED WITH DIAMOND RINGS
NOBODY KNEW
EVERY CORPSE IS A SPHYNX OF IMMORTALITY
NEVER FORMERLY HAD THE GRANDMOTHER BEEN SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO TALL
GENTLY GENTLY SAID THE RAVEN
THEY HAD A LANGUAGE TOO
SOMEONE IS JUST DEAD SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
AND THIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS A PRINCESS AND PEOPLE STREAMED TO THE CASTLE AND KAREN WAS THERE ALSO AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS STOOD IN HER FINE WHITE DRESS IN A WINDOW AND LET HERSELF BE STARED AT
BUT CLEAR-SIGHTED CALM DISCRETION DOES NOT TAKE SUCH LOFTY FLIGHTS AND UTTER SUCH HIGH NATURAL TONES
AND THERE WERE LARGE CALM LAKES THERE TOO IN WHICH WHITE SWANS WERE SWIMMING AND BEAT THE AIR WITH THEIR WINGS
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING
SHE CALLED TO MIND HIS INTELLIGENT EYES AND HIS LONG HAIR SO VIVIDLY SHE COULD QUITE SEE HIM AS HE USED TO LAUGH WHEN THEY WERE SITTING UNDER THE ROSES AT HOME
AND THE BOY GREW UP TO BE A LAD AND WAS TO GO FORTH IN THE WIDE WORLD-FAR FAR AWAY TO WARM LANDS WHERE THE COFFEE-TREE GROWS
THERE THEN CAME A WHOLE REGIMENT OF SNOW-FLAKES BUT THEY DID NOT FALL FROM ABOVE AND THEY WERE QUITE BRIGHT AND SHINING FROM THE AURORA BOREALIS
THE PENDULUM OF THE GREAT CLOCK WENT TO AND FRO AND THE HANDS TURNED AND EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM BECAME STILL OLDER
BUT I AM FAR BETTER OFF HERE
BLACK SNAILS WITHOUT A HOUSE--BUT THEY ARE SO COMMON AND SO CONCEITED
HE IS A WISE MAN SAID SHE TO HERSELF--"IT IS WELL
SHE THEN TOOK GERDA BY THE HAND LED HER INTO THE LITTLE COTTAGE AND LOCKED THE DOOR
AND IF ANYONE HAD A MOLE YOU MIGHT BE SURE THAT IT WOULD BE MAGNIFIED AND SPREAD OVER BOTH NOSE AND MOUTH
HERE SAT TWO FEMALE FIGURES A YOUNG AND AN OLD ONE
NOW I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A VISIT FROM ONE'S OLD THOUGHTS WITH WHAT THEY MAY BRING WITH THEM
SHE READ IT THREE TIMES
DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS SHE ASKED OF THE ROSES
THERE ARE ALSO RAIN-DROPS SAID MOTHER SNAIL
FORMERLY PEOPLE CALLED IT UGLY BUT THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE
WITH THE SNAKE-LIKE WRITHINGS OF AN IDEA HE GLIDED INTO ANOTHER FEMALE HEART
NOW I SHALL TELL YOU MY ADVENTURES SAID THE SHADOW
IT IS A VERY OLD NAME AND AS WELL AS I RECOLLECT HE WAS THE FIRST PRINTER THAT APPEARED IN DENMARK YES HE IS OUR FIRST PRINTER REPLIED THE CLERICAL GENTLEMAN HASTILY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD AND GONE AND LYING DOWN IN THE DEEP WATERS
IT WAS REVEALED TO ME IN THE ANTECHAMBER
GERDA CALLED TO THEM FOR SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE
THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE
PRODUCED BY DIANNE BEAN ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALES BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN CONTENTS THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES THE SWINEHERD THE REAL PRINCESS THE SHOES OF FORTUNE THE FIR TREE THE SNOW QUEEN THE LEAP-FROG THE ELDERBUSH THE BELL THE OLD HOUSE THE HAPPY FAMILY THE STORY OF A MOTHER THE FALSE COLLAR THE SHADOW THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL THE DREAM OF LITTLE TUK THE NAUGHTY BOY THE RED SHOES THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES MANY YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN EMPEROR WHO WAS SO EXCESSIVELY FOND OF NEW CLOTHES THAT HE SPENT ALL HIS MONEY IN DRESS
YES ONCE HE EVEN SHOT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER RIGHT IN THE HEART
HE WILL AFFORD US MUCH PLEASURE--AND WE HAVE NOTHING BUT HIM TO LIVE FOR
AND EXCEPTING THE FRIGHT THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD GAINED BY THE SHOES OF FORTUNE
YOU HAD BETTER LAY THE CLOTH BELOW IN THE STABLE SAID ONE OF THE TRAVELLERS
THE DREAM CONTINUED TO HAUNT HIM FOR HE STILL HAD THE SHOES ON HIS FEET
I WILL SING OF THE REJOICING OF ALL MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHERE THE CACTUS GROWS IN WANTON LUXURIANCE SPARE US YOUR ELEGIAC TONES SAID THE PARROT GIGGLING
HE WEPT SO MUCH THAT THE SPLINTER ROLLED OUT OF HIS EYE AND HE RECOGNISED HER AND SHOUTED GERDA SWEET LITTLE GERDA
BUT THE WATER BORE HER UP AS IF SHE SAT IN A SWING AND SHE FLEW IN THE ROCKING WAVES TO THE SHORE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE THERE STOOD A MILE-BROAD STRANGE HOUSE ONE KNEW NOT IF IT WERE A MOUNTAIN WITH FORESTS AND CAVERNS OR IF IT WERE BUILT UP
WELL WHAT DID THE TIGER-LILY SAY
THERE IS SUCH A PLEASANT DEATHLIKE STILLNESS IN SORBE SHE WAS NOW SUDDENLY A FROG CROAK
I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU FRETTING SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN
THE POISONOUS FLIES AND GNATS SWARMED AROUND BY THOUSANDS
AND SHE WAS INDUSTRIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL
BUT THE OLD MAN WAS GONE AND HER LITTLE CHILD WAS GONE--HE HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM
STILL THE LITTLE VEHICLE RUSHED ON WITH THE QUICKNESS OF THE WIND
SOME PERSONS CANNOT BEAR TO TOUCH GREY PAPER OR THEY BECOME ILL
I THINK I HAVE NOT GIVEN THE LEAST OCCASION FOR IT YES
IF ANYONE HAD PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN QUITE DISTINCTLY THAT THE SHADOW WENT IN THROUGH THE HALF-OPEN BALCONY-DOOR OF THEIR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR JUST AS THE STRANGER WENT INTO HIS OWN ROOM AND LET THE LONG CURTAIN FALL DOWN AFTER HIM
SHE WAS TALL AND OF SLENDER FIGURE AND OF A DAZZLING WHITENESS
YES HE MUST BE THERE
AND IF THE LEARNED MAN NOW CAME THERE AND TOLD HIS STORY THEY WOULD SAY THAT HE WAS IMITATING IT AND THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO DO
THOU ART RIGHTLY SERVED HE THEN WENT BACK TO HIS OWN LITTLE KINGDOM AND SHUT THE DOOR OF HIS PALACE IN HER FACE
WILL YOU GIVE THIS TO THE OLD MAN OVER THE WAY FROM ME
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH WERE PRETTY NEARLY AS FOLLOWS
FOR THAT ONE COULD SEE ON HIS BACK IF THERE WOULD BE A SEVERE OR MILD WINTER AND THAT WAS WHAT ONE COULD NOT SEE EVEN ON THE BACK OF THE MAN WHO WRITES THE ALMANAC
DWELLERS IN THE MOON
YOU MUST REMAIN
BUT TWAS DROLL ENOUGH ALTOGETHER
IT IS LOVELY HERE IN SUMMER SAID SHE
BATS FLUTTERED WILDLY ABOUT THE CEILING
THE HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT WAS USED AS A WEATHER-COCK WHICH WAS CONNECTED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER WITH THE DOORS AND SO THEY OPENED AND SHUT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WHENEVER THE STERN OLD HUSBAND TURNED ROUND
THE YOUNG WIFE WIPED THE DIRT OFF THE SOLDIER FIRST WITH A GREEN LEAF AND THEN WITH HER FINE HANDKERCHIEF--IT HAD SUCH A DELIGHTFUL SMELL THAT IT WAS TO THE PEWTER SOLDIER JUST AS IF HE HAD AWAKED FROM A TRANCE
SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
PRAY HOW DID YOU COME INTO POSSESSION OF THIS RARE PRINT
DU LIEBER AUGUSTIN ALLES IST WEG WEG WEG THE REAL PRINCESS THERE WAS ONCE A PRINCE WHO WISHED TO MARRY A PRINCESS
AND PRESENTED THE IMPOSTORS WITH THE RIBAND OF AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD TO BE WORN IN THEIR BUTTON-HOLES AND THE TITLE OF GENTLEMEN WEAVERS THE ROGUES SAT UP THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT BEFORE THE DAY ON WHICH THE PROCESSION WAS TO TAKE PLACE AND HAD SIXTEEN LIGHTS BURNING SO THAT EVERYONE MIGHT SEE HOW ANXIOUS THEY WERE TO FINISH THE EMPEROR'S NEW SUIT
I SAW THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE THINGS WITH THE WOMEN WITH THE MEN WITH PARENTS AND WITH THE SWEET MATCHLESS CHILDREN
YOU ARE DOUBTLESS A PRINCESS NO SAID LITTLE GERDA
IT WAS THE SHOES THAT CAUSED THE METAMORPHOSIS BY MEANS OF WHICH UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF HE TOOK UPON HIM THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE OFFICER
II
IN THE MIDST OF THE LARGE OLD SMOKING HALL BURNT A GREAT FIRE ON THE STONE FLOOR
NOW KAREN WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE CONFIRMED
THE BIRDS IN THE WOOD HAD NEVER RELATED THE LIKE OF THIS
I KNEW NOT THEY WERE THINE
BUT WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF THAT
WHAT A NICE LITTLE FIR BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
THE OTHER WAS RED AND IT WAS HERE THAT GERDA WAS TO LOOK FOR LITTLE KAY
DO YOU THINK HE GETS MILD EYES OR A CHRISTMAS TREE
BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE
AND ONCE A YEAR WHEN I SIT ON THE BALCONY IN THE SUNSHINE THOU MUST LIE AT MY FEET AS A SHADOW SHALL DO
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE WAY HITHER
IT TOOK ITS DIRECTION TOWARDS THE BODY IN A STRAIGHT LINE
WITH A FEW STROKES OF HIS WINGS HE WAS OUT OF THE CAGE
IN A SMALL COURT THE BRIGHT SUN WAS SHINING IN THE FIRST DAYS OF SPRING
YES OF THAT SHE THOUGHT
HE AT LAST CONSTRUCTED A RATTLE WHICH WHEN IT WAS SWUNG ROUND PLAYED ALL THE WALTZES AND JIG TUNES WHICH HAVE EVER BEEN HEARD SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD
SHE THEN HAD A PRETTY BED WITH A RED SILKEN COVERLET FILLED WITH BLUE VIOLETS
THE WATCHMAN ENTERED INTO THE BEING AND NATURE OF THE LIEUTENANT
THEN THEY PLAYED IN A SIDE AVENUE AND MARKED OUT A LITTLE GARDEN ON THE EARTH
TIS EAST STREET
THERE WAS NEVER EVEN A LITTLE BEAR-BALL WITH THE STORM FOR MUSIC WHILE THE POLAR BEARS WENT ON THEIR HIND LEGS AND SHOWED OFF THEIR STEPS
HERE ARE YOUR WORSTED LEGGINS FOR IT WILL BE COLD
BUT ON LOOKING NEARER ONE SOON SAW THEY COULD SCARCELY BE MERE SERVANTS
THAT'S WHAT IT IS NO DOUBT SAID HE
YET THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF RESEMBLANCE TO SUCH A DEGREE HAS EVERYTHING CHANGED THIS NIGHT
NOW LOOK DOWN INTO THE DEEP WELL CLOSE BY
I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT PRUDE EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR
ONE MIGHT ALMOST FANCY THE PEOPLE HAD TURNED HEATHENS AGAIN
MY TOWN IS JUST LIKE A BOTTLE
IT WAS AS IF THE TONES CAME FROM A CHURCH IN THE STILL FOREST
FOR MY PART I SHALL GO IN THE SALOONS WERE GLEAMING WITH LUSTRES--PRIVY COUNCILLORS AND EXCELLENCIES WERE WALKING ABOUT BAREFOOTED AND WORE GOLD KEYS
BUT THEY SAID THE STORIES WERE NOT INTERESTING WHICH VEXED THE LITTLE MICE
BUT OF THAT OF COURSE SHE NEVER ONCE NOW THOUGHT
AND THOSE PARTS THAT WERE LIKE IT PLEASED THEM BEST
THE EVENING WAS CLOSING IN WHEN THE RAVEN RETURNED
HERE THE FIRST VEGETATION PEEPED FORTH
AND THEN SHE SAID SHE WAS SITTING IN THE MIRROR OF UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY ONE AND THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD
THEY ASKED FOR THE MOST DELICATE SILK AND THE PUREST GOLD THREAD
FOR CERTAIN THAT WAS KAY SAID GERDA
RISCHT HOW IT BLAZED HOW IT BURNT
AT THE TIME I WAS WITH YOU I THOUGHT NOT OF THAT BUT ALWAYS--YOU KNOW IT WELL--WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN I BECAME SO STRANGELY GREAT
AND THE CHILDREN CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND CRIED
CAW GOOD DAY
THESE ARE INDEED ROYAL ROBES THE CANOPY WHICH IS TO BE BORNE OVER YOUR MAJESTY IN THE PROCESSION IS WAITING ANNOUNCED THE CHIEF MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES
THERE SHE BEHELD KAY
THE BOY SAW IT ALL AND YET THEY WERE ONLY GOING ROUND THE GRASS-PLOT
LOOK THE WEATHER IS NOW CLEARING UP AND THE MOON IS SHINING CLEAR AGAIN THROUGH THE WINDOW WHY YOUR BOW IS QUITE SPOILED SAID THE OLD POET
IT WAS JUST AS IF SHE HAD BEEN ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING WRONG
IT WAS--YES GUESS
IT MUST BE THAT I AM NOT FIT FOR MY GOOD PROFITABLE OFFICE
THAT SURELY CANNOT BE THE BELL SAID ONE OF THE CHILDREN LYING DOWN AND LISTENING
BESIDES IT IS GOOD FOR THE ORANGES AND THE GRAPES AND THEN AWAY SHE FLEW AND KAY SAT QUITE ALONE IN THE EMPTY HALLS OF ICE THAT WERE MILES LONG AND LOOKED AT THE BLOCKS OF ICE AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL HIS SKULL WAS ALMOST CRACKED
THE LITTLE BOY WAS FRIGHTENED AND JUMPED DOWN FROM THE CHAIR
THE WHOLE MAN SHRUNK TOGETHER AND A MOST UNCOMMON JOURNEY THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THE FRONT ROW OF SPECTATORS NOW BEGAN
FOR HE WAS A REAL BOASTER
SHE IMMEDIATELY LOOSENED LITTLE GERDA'S CLOTHES PULLED OFF HER THICK GLOVES AND BOOTS
I WISH TO HEAVEN I COULD WALK IN AND TAKE A TRIP RIGHT THROUGH THE HEARTS OF THOSE PRESENT AND BEHOLD
NOR WAS THERE A SINGLE PERSON IN THE WELL-CRAMMED CARRIAGE WHOSE FACE WAS NOT SWOLLEN AND SORE FROM THEIR RAVENOUS BITES
O HEAVENS
IT WAS THE PEWTER SOLDIER HE THAT WAS LOST UP AT THE OLD MAN'S AND HAD TUMBLED AND TURNED ABOUT AMONGST THE TIMBER AND THE RUBBISH AND HAD AT LAST LAID FOR MANY YEARS IN THE GROUND
ALL WE HEAR OR SAY IN A DREAM THAT IS FAIR AND BEAUTIFUL IS LIKE THE GOLD OF THE SUBTERRANEAN SPIRITS
THE SENTRY WAS OUR YOUNG DIVINE
NO FRESHER ROSE HANGS ON THE BRANCHES THAN SHE
HOW IS THIS SAID THE EMPEROR TO HIMSELF
NONE BUT A REAL PRINCESS COULD HAVE HAD SUCH A DELICATE SENSE OF FEELING
POOR THING SAID THE LAPLAND WOMAN YOU HAVE FAR TO RUN STILL
FIE PAPA SAID SHE
SHE LOOKED AT THE LITTLE GIRL FELT COMPASSION FOR HER AND THEN SAID TO THE CLERGYMAN
BUT ONE CANNOT HOWEVER RELY UPON IT ENTIRELY
THAT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SAID THE LEARNED MAN
YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THOSE MEN-FOLKS I AM ALSO A FINE GENTLEMAN SAID THE COLLAR
THE SNOW CRACKLED UNDER FOOT AS IF ONE HAD NEW BOOTS ON
AND WHEN SHE DANCED TOWARDS THE OPEN CHURCH DOOR SHE SAW AN ANGEL STANDING THERE
THERE NEED NOT HOWEVER BE ANY HASTE ABOUT THAT
YOU HAVE HAD A GOOD SLEEP WHILE I HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE AND ARGUING WITH HIM WHETHER IT WAS A STORY OR A FAIRY TALE AND WHERE IS OLD NANNY ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
SHE EMBRACED LITTLE GERDA AND SAID THEY SHALL NOT KILL YOU AS LONG AS I AM NOT DISPLEASED WITH YOU
ABOUT POLITICS THEY HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY
TREES WHICH OFTEN WERE NOT EVEN AS LARGE OR OF THE SAME AGE AS THIS FIR TREE WHO COULD NEVER REST BUT ALWAYS WANTED TO BE OFF
I'LL SPEAK TO MY TAME SWEETHEART ABOUT IT
I OPENED IT INSTANTLY AND READ
THERE WERE LARGE TREES IN SMALL POTS SO THAT THEY STOOD SO STUNTED IN GROWTH AND READY TO BURST THE POTS
THEY RAN ABOUT WITH THE MIRROR
A SWING A BURSTING BUBBLE--SUCH IS MY SONG WHAT YOU RELATE MAY BE VERY PRETTY BUT YOU TELL IT IN SO MELANCHOLY A MANNER AND DO NOT MENTION KAY WHAT DO THE HYACINTHS SAY
THE OLD MINISTER LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR WORDS IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT REPEAT THEM TO THE EMPEROR
THEN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPREAD OUT MY BRANCHES AND WITH THE TOPS TO LOOK INTO THE WIDE WORLD
WHAT AM I TO DO HERE
HOW THOUGHTFUL THAT IS
THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS
LARGE BLOCKS OF STONE LAY THERE OVERGROWN WITH MOSS OF EVERY COLOR
THIS IS CERTAINLY THE HEART OF AN OLD MAID THOUGHT HE
SOME ONE WILL MAKE A MISTAKE FOR CERTAIN AND TAKE THE WRONG ONES--HE WILL BE A HAPPY MAN SUCH WAS THEIR CONVERSATION
OTHERS LIKE SNAKES KNOTTED TOGETHER WITH THEIR HEADS STICKING OUT
WHAT A STATE HE WAS IN
FOR IT IS NOT SO AMUSING WHERE THERE IS NO PRIZE TO JUMP FOR THE FLEA WAS THE FIRST TO STEP FORWARD
LET ME IN
NOW SOLD FOR A FEW PENCE AS A LARK
SHE HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PARTNER IN THE DANCE
I HAVE SCARCELY CLOSED MY EYES THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
HE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL BUT HE WAS SO PALE AND HIS WHOLE BODY TREMBLED WITH COLD
SHE CAME CLOSE TO THEM FOR THE STREAM DRIFTED THE BOAT QUITE NEAR THE LAND
NOW YOU BE WISE AND ACCEPT THE OFFER
THERE TOO I SAW MANY SPLENDIDLY-DRESSED PAROQUETS THAT TOLD THE DROLLEST STORIES AND THE WILDEST FAIRY TALES WITHOUT END OH
AND THE MAN TOLD ABOUT HUMPY-DUMPY THAT TUMBLED DOWN WHO NOTWITHSTANDING CAME TO THE THRONE AND AT LAST MARRIED THE PRINCESS
AND HE DANCES DELIGHTFULLY--THAT IS ALSO GOOD
AND ALTHOUGH THE WATER TRICKLED DOWN HIS HAIR IT WAVED IN BEAUTIFUL CURLS
BUT HE STILL HEARD THE LITTLE BELL WITH WHICH THE OTHERS WERE SO SATISFIED AND NOW AND THEN WHEN THE WIND BLEW HE COULD ALSO HEAR THE PEOPLE SINGING WHO WERE SITTING AT TEA WHERE THE CONFECTIONER HAD HIS TENT
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN FED ON NUT-KERNELS SAID THE OLD FEMALE ROBBER WHO HAD A LONG SCRUBBY BEARD AND BUSHY EYEBROWS THAT HUNG DOWN OVER HER EYES
AND NOW SHE WAS AN OLD WOMAN
FOR I COST MORE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY ONE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
I SHALL BECOME A LUMP OF ICE AND SHE PRESSED THE THORN-BUSH TO HER BREAST SO FIRMLY THAT IT MIGHT BE THOROUGHLY WARMED AND THE THORNS WENT RIGHT INTO HER FLESH AND HER BLOOD FLOWED IN LARGE DROPS BUT THE THORNBUSH SHOT FORTH FRESH GREEN LEAVES AND THERE CAME FLOWERS ON IT IN THE COLD WINTER NIGHT THE HEART OF THE AFFLICTED MOTHER WAS SO WARM
SO HIS MOTHER UNDRESSED HIM PUT HIM TO BED AND HAD THE TEA-POT BROUGHT IN TO MAKE HIM A GOOD CUP OF ELDERFLOWER TEA
BUT THIS TIME IN SPITE OF HIS CLEVERNESS HE GUESSED QUITE WRONG FOR IT WAS JUST THOSE OF FORTUNE WHICH PLAYED AS IT WERE INTO HIS HANDS OR RATHER ON HIS FEET
AND WHILST SHE READ WITH A PIOUS MIND THE WIND BORE THE STRAINS OF THE ORGAN TOWARDS HER AND SHE RAISED HER TEARFUL COUNTENANCE AND SAID O GOD HELP ME AND THE SUN SHONE SO CLEARLY AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HER STOOD THE ANGEL OF GOD IN WHITE GARMENTS THE SAME SHE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT AT THE CHURCH DOOR
AND INSTANTLY THROUGH IT SLIPPED EASILY AND WITHOUT PAIN NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS PRETTY LARGE AND THICK
WILL YOU GO WITH ME
WHAT'S THAT WOMAN'S NAME ASKED THE LITTLE BOY
BUT EVEN IN THIS SLEEP THERE CAME A DREAM OR WHATEVER ELSE IT WAS
HE NOW WISHED TO BE A MERRY CHIRPING BIRD
BUT THE GARTER WAS SO BASHFUL SO MODEST AND THOUGHT IT WAS A STRANGE QUESTION TO ANSWER
BUT THE RAVEN ASKED LITTLE GERDA
HOWEVER A THING OF THAT SORT SHE NEVER FORGETS
PERHAPS THE SPARROWS WILL BEAT AGAINST THE WINDOWPANES
IT IS SURPRISING HOW WELL YOU PRESERVE YOUR TEETH MISS SAID THE COLLAR
THE LITTLE MAIDEN OPENED THE DOOR CALLED IN ALL THE DOGS AND THEN WITH HER KNIFE CUT THE ROPE THAT FASTENED THE ANIMAL AND SAID TO HIM NOW OFF WITH YOU
THE REINDEER AND THE YOUNG HIND LEAPED ALONG BESIDE THEM AND ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE BOUNDARY OF THE COUNTRY
OH SAID THE COLLAR
AND YET IT IS UNDENIABLY MY OWN HANDWRITING
FOR THIS THEY HAVE COVERED YOU OVER--THEY NEVER DO THE LIKE TO ME
BESIDES HOW ASHAMED WOULD HE HAVE BEEN TO BE FOUND CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE AN OUTWITTED FOX
IF THE TAPERS WERE BUT LIGHTED
AND WHEN THEY HEARD HER INTENTION ALL WERE VERY PLEASED AND SAID WE ARE VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT
YES--EVEN WHEN HE JUMPED OVER ME
AND SHE PULLED DOWN HER STOCKINGS BUT THE SHOES SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN TO HER FEET
AND THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT
OTHERWISE HE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO MANKIND AND THE SNOW QUEEN WILL RETAIN HER POWER OVER HIM BUT CAN YOU GIVE LITTLE GERDA NOTHING TO TAKE WHICH WILL ENDUE HER WITH POWER OVER THE WHOLE I CAN GIVE HER NO MORE POWER THAN WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY
IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO
AND SHE SAW THE OTHER'S LIFE AND IT WAS SORROW AND DISTRESS HORROR AND WRETCHEDNESS
FOR SOME OF THESE PIECES WERE HARDLY SO LARGE AS A GRAIN OF SAND AND THEY FLEW ABOUT IN THE WIDE WORLD AND WHEN THEY GOT INTO PEOPLE'S EYES THERE THEY STAYED
THE BRIDGE LEADING TO PALACE SQUARE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
FOR IN OUR SOULS THERE GERMINATE FAR GREATER POWERS THAN WE POOR MORTALS DESPITE ALL OUR CLEVERNESS HAVE ANY NOTION OF
BUT SHE BEGGED TO HAVE A LITTLE CARRIAGE WITH A HORSE IN FRONT AND FOR A SMALL PAIR OF SHOES
THE SUN WAS SHINING GLORIOUSLY
SO VERY LARGE
BESIDES IF HE COULD MANAGE IT HE WOULD GET BEHIND HER PUT ON HER SPECTACLES AND IMITATE HER WAY OF SPEAKING
HE TELLS THE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO SET THEM ALL THINKING AND GUESSING
WELL PLEASED THE LITTLE MAGICIAN HASTENED AWAY TO PROVE THE POWERS OF THE SPECTACLES IN THE THEATRE
HEAREST THOU NOT THE DRUM
THE SLEDGE DROVE ROUND THE SQUARE TWICE AND KAY TIED ON HIS SLEDGE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND OFF HE DROVE WITH IT
AND ONE FALLING STAR AFTER THE OTHER WAS SEEN IN THE SKY
AND IT WILL CERTAINLY BE BENEFICIAL FOR A PERSON WHO LEADS SO SEDENTARY A LIFE
PRINCESSES HE FOUND IN PLENTY
THE LITTLE ROBBER MAIDEN WAS AS TALL AS GERDA BUT STRONGER BROADER-SHOULDERED AND OF DARK COMPLEXION
I WAS BORN AND BRED THERE--THERE I LEAPT ABOUT ON THE FIELDS OF SNOW LISTEN SAID THE ROBBER MAIDEN TO GERDA
IT WAS A SORT OF HOSTELRY OF THOSE TIMES
FOR THEY IMAGINED THAT EVERYONE ELSE COULD SEE THIS EXQUISITE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP
THE PRINCE ACCORDINGLY MADE HER HIS WIFE
IT IS AS IF SOME ONE SAT THERE AND PRACTISED A PIECE THAT HE COULD NOT MASTER--ALWAYS THE SAME PIECE
EXCELLENT RESOUNDED ON ALL SIDES
AND WHEN SHE SAW THE CASKETS WITH THE PRESENTS SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY
AND THE LITTLE MAIDEN SHOWED THE BOY EVERYTHING
BE USEFUL AND DO ME A SERVICE SAID HE IN JEST
OH HOW LONG I HAVE STAYED SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
THAT DOES NOT CONCERN ME AND THEN OFF SHE RAN TO THE FURTHER END OF THE GARDEN
THE NEXT SUNDAY THERE WAS THE SACRAMENT AND KAREN LOOKED AT THE BLACK SHOES LOOKED AT THE RED ONES--LOOKED AT THEM AGAIN AND PUT ON THE RED SHOES
I LIKE READING ALL USEFUL WORKS
THE RED COLORS ABOVE FADED AWAY AS THE SUN VANISHED BUT A MILLION STARS WERE LIGHTED A MILLION LAMPS SHONE
ONE HALL WAS MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN THE OTHER
BUT FIRST WE WENT TO SCHOOL TO LEARN SOMEWHAT SAID SHE
YONDER IN THE CANAL LAY THE SHIPS FROZEN UP AND DESERTED BY THEIR WHOLE CREWS WITH A SCREAMING CROW FOR THE SOLE OCCUPANT
HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN
HOW WAS HE TO TWIST HIMSELF THROUGH
HE PERCEIVED IMMEDIATELY A QUANTITY OF BEINGS WHO WERE CERTAINLY WHAT WE CALL MEN
THE COURT ADJOINED A GARDEN AND ALL WAS IN FLOWER
HOW MUCH THE BIRD REMINDS ME OF THE MUSICAL BOX THAT BELONGED TO OUR BLESSED EMPRESS SAID AN OLD KNIGHT
YET IT WAS LIKE A PIECE OF ENCHANTMENT
MARCH OUT SAID THE EMPEROR FOR HE WAS VERY ANGRY
SAVE THE INNOCENT
THEN A KNOCKING WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND IN CAME A POOR OLD MAN WRAPPED UP AS IN A LARGE HORSE-CLOTH FOR IT WARMS ONE AND HE NEEDED IT AS IT WAS THE COLD WINTER SEASON
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY UNUSUAL SHADOW
BUT BEFORE IT WHERE THE OLD HOUSE HAD IN FACT STOOD WAS A LITTLE GARDEN LAID OUT AND A WILD GRAPEVINE RAN UP THE WALL OF THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE
BUT THESE TWO THINGS WOULD NOT DO TOGETHER AT ALL
HIS TAME SWEETHEART IS A WIDOW AND WEARS A BIT OF BLACK WORSTED ROUND HER LEG
AND THERE IT HUNG FOR NO ONE KNEW HER MORE--NO ONE CARED ABOUT THE OLD PICTURE
WHAT IS COME TO ME
THE TEA-POT WAS STANDING ON THE TABLE BUT NO ELDER TREE WAS GROWING OUT OF IT
THEY AFTERWARDS CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE MADE OF BRANCHES AND THE BARK OF TREES
HOWEVER TOWARDS MORNING SHE TAKES A DRAUGHT OUT OF THE LARGE FLASK AND THEN SHE SLEEPS A LITTLE
I WILL GIVE MY DAUGHTER TO HIM WHO JUMPS HIGHEST EXCLAIMED THE KING
SHE STANDS NOW ON ONE LEG NOW ON BOTH
AND WHO LIVED THERE
BUT MY GRANDMOTHER UNDERSTANDS IT AND SHE CAN SPEAK GIBBERISH TOO
SET HER DOWN BY THE LARGE BUSH WITH RED BERRIES STANDING IN THE SNOW
WE HAVE SEEN LITTLE KAY
OUR LORD WILL NOT TAKE HIM FROM ME AND THE OLD MAN--IT WAS DEATH HIMSELF--HE NODDED SO STRANGELY IT COULD JUST AS WELL SIGNIFY YES AS NO
BY THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS TO HAVE LEARNT ALL THE TOWNS IN ZEALAND BY HEART AND TO KNOW ABOUT THEM ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO BE KNOWN
IT WAS AS THOUGH THE OLD WASHERWOMAN GAZED ON HIM WITH HER MILD EYES AND SAID IT WERE A GREAT SIN IF YOU WERE NOT TO KNOW YOUR LESSON TOMORROW MORNING
BUT ALL HE COULD DO HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO REMEMBER THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
AND IT IS AS DIRTY AS IF ONE HAD TO WADE THROUGH A MORASS THE LONGER HE SPOKE WITH THE BOATMEN THE MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE DID THEIR LANGUAGE BECOME TO HIM
BUT GERDA COULD NOT CLOSE HER EYES FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS TO LIVE OR DIE
IT IS THE BODICE
AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE GRANDCHILDREN DANCED AROUND THEM AND CALLED OUT QUITE DELIGHTED THAT THERE WAS TO BE SOMETHING VERY SPLENDID THAT EVENING--THEY WERE ALL TO HAVE HOT POTATOES
HE WAS SO UNEASY LEST HE SHOULD LOSE SOMETHING OF HIS SPLENDOR THAT HE WAS QUITE BEWILDERED AMIDST THE GLARE AND BRIGHTNESS
AND THE MOTHER LOOKED STILL MORE SORROWFULLY ON THE LITTLE CREATURE
A COARSE HAND SOUGHT ITS WAY CAREFULLY IN UNDER THE BROAD RIM AND SEIZED THE CLERK OVER THE BACK AND WINGS
CROAK
POOR CHILD SAID THE OLD POET AS HE TOOK THE BOY BY THE HAND
THAT WAS DELIGHTFUL
THE HINDOO WOMAN IN HER LONG ROBE STANDS UPON THE FUNERAL PILE
BUT YET I GREW NOT RICH
DARK IS THE FUTURE NOW
THE LEARNED MAN THEN CAME HOME AND HE WROTE BOOKS ABOUT WHAT WAS TRUE IN THE WORLD AND ABOUT WHAT WAS GOOD AND WHAT WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND IT WAS ON IT THAT KAY GAZED DURING THE LONG LONG WINTER'S NIGHT
I AM BETROTHED--TO THE BOOT-JACK BETROTHED EXCLAIMED THE COLLAR
IT'S A STRANGE RACE THOSE POETS SAID THE CLERK WHO WAS VERY FOND OF SOLILOQUIZING
SHE CREPT ALONG TREMBLING WITH COLD AND HUNGER--A VERY PICTURE OF SORROW THE POOR LITTLE THING
HER SOUL FLEW ON THE SUNSHINE TO GOD AND THERE NO ONE ASKED AFTER THE RED SHOES
YOUR NAME SHALL CIRCULATE WITH RENOWN ALL ROUND THE EARTH LIKE UNTO THE SHIP THAT WAS TO HAVE SAILED FROM CORSOR
IT WAS FULL OF CRACKS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
WHEN SHE LEFT HOME SHE HAD SLIPPERS ON IT IS TRUE
THEY KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT WAS COOKING AT EVERY FIRE THROUGHOUT THE CITY FROM THE CHAMBERLAIN'S TO THE COBBLER'S
BUT THE OLD ONES ESPECIALLY DAME MOTHER SNAIL THOUGHT THEY COULD OBSERVE HOW HE INCREASED IN SIZE AND SHE BEGGED FATHER IF HE COULD NOT SEE IT THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST FEEL THE LITTLE SNAIL'S SHELL
BUT YET HE CANNOT MASTER IT HOWEVER LONG HE PLAYS THE WORD MAHOGANY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN DANISH AS HAVING TWO MEANINGS
YOU MUST NOT BE UNWELL THIS EVENING NOW THAT WE ARE TO HAVE OUR NUPTIALS CELEBRATED I HAVE LIVED TO SEE THE MOST CRUEL THING THAT ANYONE CAN LIVE TO SEE SAID THE SHADOW
HE WAS UNABLE TO PUT HIS THOUGHTS IN ORDER AND FANCIED THAT HIS TOO LIVELY IMAGINATION HAD RUN AWAY WITH HIM
THIS IS CALLED DRINKING DUUS
EVERY EVENING HE GOES TO A PARTY WHERE HIS NICE SUPPER COSTS HIM NOTHING
WHERE DO YOU LIVE ASKED THE COLLAR
IT IS REALLY PLEASANT ENOUGH SAID HE
BUT IN THE WARM LANDS EVERYTHING GROWS SO QUICKLY
SHE IS SO PRETTY CLEVER AND SO KIND OH DID SHE KNOW WHAT'S HIDDEN IN MY MIND A TALE OF OLD
OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A FIXED APPOINTMENT AS COURT RAVENS WITH ALL THE BROKEN BITS FROM THE KITCHEN AND BOTH THE RAVENS NODDED AND BEGGED FOR A FIXED APPOINTMENT
HE ROSE ON HIS TIPTOES
BUT FOR THAT IT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL HERE OLD FIR WOULDN'T IT I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE
THERE STOOD THE TREE QUITE HIDDEN
DANCE IN THY RED SHOES TILL THOU ART PALE AND COLD
