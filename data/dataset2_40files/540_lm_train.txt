BRUSH YOURSELF SAID THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER
SHE HAD ONE OF HER SHOE HEELS MADE AN INCH OR SO HIGHER THAN THE OTHER THAT SHE MIGHT NOT LIMP SO MUCH AND PUT IN A CUNNINGLY MADE GLASS EYE IN THE PLACE OF THE ONE SHE HAD LOST
WHEN HIS TAILOR HAD SETTLED EVERYTHING HE WENT HOME
WE MUST SET OUT FOR IT AT THE BREAK OF DAY MAY WE HAVE THE HONOUR OF TRAVELLING WITH YOU--THIS RESPECTABLE CRICKET AND MYSELF SAID THE GRASSHOPPER STEPPING FORWARD
LET HER BE SHUT UP IN MY GREAT TOWER WITH HER NURSE AND THOSE WHO BROUGHT HER HERE
THE MOMENT MARYA MOREVNA HAD GONE HE RUSHED TO THE CLOSET PULLED OPEN THE DOOR AND LOOKED IN--THERE HUNG KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS FETTERED BY TWELVE CHAINS
MUCH BETTER FLY WITH ME WHILE KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS IS OUT OF SIGHT
WHEN THEY WERE SAFE AT HOME THE WITCH SAID TO THE MAN
AND IF THOU ART A WOMAN AND AN OLD ONE THOU SHALT BE MY GRANDMOTHER
THE NURSE AND HER DAUGHTER AND THE BOATMAN WERE BROUGHT ALSO
THEN THE WHOLE FOREST RANG WITH SUCH A BLOWING OF HORNS BAYING OF DOGS AND JOYFUL CRIES OF HUNTSMEN THAT THE LITTLE ROE HEARD IT AND LONGED TO JOIN IN TOO
NOW I SEE SOMETHING LIKE A BLUISH STREAK FAR FAR AWAY THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT THERE WAS A LONG HANDSOME BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THEY AGAIN TRAVELLED ON A LONG LONG WAY AND THEN ONCE MORE THE FOAL INQUIRED IF CINDERLAD SAW ANYTHING
WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE UPON THE MATTER MY CHILD SAID THE FAIRY A CROWN IS A VERY PRETTY THING BUT YOU KNOW NEITHER THE PRICE NOR THE WEIGHT OF IT I KNOW SO WELL THAT I HAVE REFUSED TO WEAR ONE SAID THE LITTLE MAIDEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHO WAS MY FATHER OR WHO WAS MY MOTHER AND I HAVE NOT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE GOODNESS AND BEAUTY WHICH ARE OF MORE VALUE THAN TEN KINGDOMS SAID THE WISE FAIRY
OUR HALVOR WAS SO IDLE AND SLOTHFUL THAT HE NEVER DID ANYTHING AT ALL AND HE WAS SO RAGGED THAT ONE HOLE RAN INTO ANOTHER ALL OVER HIS CLOTHES
I ALWAYS TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE DRAGGED THE UNLUCKY QUEEN OUT INTO THE NEAREST WOOD AND CLIMBED UP INTO A TREE TO LOOK FOR A BRANCH TO WHICH HE COULD HANG HER
HE WAS SORRY FOR ALL THE EVIL HE HAD DONE OUT OF PRIDE AND IMPLORED RENELDE TO FORGIVE HIM
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOURSELF AND DELICIA ANSWERED
DAPPLEGRIM THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A COUPLE OF RICH FOLKS WHO HAD TWELVE SONS AND WHEN THE YOUNGEST WAS GROWN UP HE WOULD NOT STAY AT HOME ANY LONGER BUT WOULD GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND SEEK HIS FORTUNE
NOW GUDRUN FELL IN LOVE WITH SIGURD BUT HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING OF BRYNHILD HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS AND HOW DEAR
SO THEY RUSHED ON EACH OTHER AND FOUGHT AND AS FOR THE BULL HE BUTTED AND KICKED WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HIS BODY BUT THE TROLL FOUGHT QUITE AS WELL AS HE DID AND THE WHOLE DAY WENT BY BEFORE THE BULL PUT AN END TO HIM AND THEN HE HIMSELF WAS SO FULL OF WOUNDS AND SO WORN OUT THAT HE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO MOVE
NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS FATED THAT SHE SHOULD BE MINE HE SAID TO THE KING
YOUR EXCELLENCY IT IS THE BIRD REPLIED THE SCULLION AND HE PLACED IT IN HIS HAND
AS TO THE QUEEN SHE WAS SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SPEAK
AND THEY WERE ALL SO ASTOUNDED THAT THEY RAN DOWN TO SEE WHAT MANNER OF MAN THIS COULD BE WHO CAME SAILING IN A SHIP THROUGH THE AIR
THEN SAID BROTHER
AT THE BANQUET THE PRINCE INVITED HER TO SIT NEXT HIM IN THE PLACE OF HONOUR
BUT THERE ARE GOOD STORIES ENOUGH LEFT AND IT IS HOPED THAT SOME IN THE RED FAIRY BOOK MAY HAVE THE ATTRACTION OF BEING LESS FAMILIAR THAN MANY OF THE OLD FRIENDS
I SEE NO WAY OF SAVING OUR SONS EXCEPT BY HAVING ROSETTE'S HEAD CUT OFF WHILE SHE IS STILL LITTLE BUT THE QUEEN CRIED THAT SHE WOULD FAR RATHER HAVE HER OWN HEAD CUT OFF AND THAT HE HAD BETTER THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE FOR SHE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO SUCH A THING
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SHIPWRECK FOR NO DOGS EVER PASSED THAT WAY BY ANY CHANCE AND HE WENT OUT TO SEE IF HE COULD BE OF ANY USE
MEANWHILE THE KING AND THE PRINCE WERE CONSIDERING HOW THEY SHOULD FIND THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS IF THERE WAS SUCH A PERSON IN THE WORLD
THEN ALL THAT MINNIKIN HAD ASKED FOR WAS BROUGHT
SHE FOUND HIM THE BEST PARTNER IN THE WORLD BUT HE DID NOT DARE TO SPEAK A SINGLE WORD TO HER
I AM SNOWDROP WHY DID YOU COME TO OUR HOUSE CONTINUED THE DWARFS
ON THE THIRD DAY ALL HAPPENED IN THE SAME WAY
AND SO TELLING THE PRINCE THE MOST OF HIS ADVENTURES HE ASKED HIM AGAIN WHERE THEY WERE BOUND FOR OR WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT
HOW UGLY SHE IS WHICH OFFENDED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE SAID TO THE GUARDS
NOW THEY ARE CHANGED FOR EVER INTO RAVENS THE GIRL ASKED SOBBING
NEVER IN ALL LOCQUIGNOL HAD SUCH A THING BEEN HEARD OF AS THE SPINNING OF NETTLES
WASH YOURSELF ANSWERED THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER
I FEEL AS IF I WERE THE DAUGHTER OF SOME GREAT KING AND WOULD YOU BE GLAD IF YOU WERE SAID THE FAIRY
AS IF I WOULD KISS YOUR UGLY MOUTH SAID THE GIRL
AH AH
HE ENTERED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND IN THE HALL THE TERRIBLE OLD FAIRY MET HIM
ONE FINE DAY AS SHE WAS SITTING ALONE SHE SAW AN OLD WITCH GO PAST
SOMEONE MUST HAVE STOLEN MY GOOD WINE AND PUT ALL THIS RUBBISH IN ITS PLACE RUBBISH DO YOU CALL IT MADAM GRUMBLY CRIED THE KING
WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HIM ALL HER ADVENTURES HE SAID TO HER
THE SUN WENT DOWN BEHIND THE FOREST
AT THIS THE QUEEN WAS MUCH HORRIFIED
THEN THE LAD FOUND THAT HE HAD LOST HIS POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF AND WOULD GO OUT IN THE BOAT AFTER IT
MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GET INTO MY THROAT--GO INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU AH
AND AGAIN A GOLDEN EGG LAY ON THE TABLE
THE PRINCE THOUGHT ALL THE ROOMS LOOKED STRANGELY OLD-FASHIONED WITH THEIR ANTIQUE FURNITURE BUT AS THERE WAS A GOOD LIBRARY HE WAS PLEASED FOR HE WAS VERY FOND OF READING AND HE SOON GOT PERMISSION TO HAVE AS MANY BOOKS AS HE LIKED
AND WHEN HE GOT THERE HE HUNG UP THE ROBES ON THE WALL AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
IF YOU WISH TO BE PRETTY YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WAY BUT YOU WILL ALSO BE VAIN CAPRICIOUS AND FRIVOLOUS
THEY COULD SEE NEITHER MOON NOR STARS BUT IN THE QUEEN'S NECK-HANDKERCHIEF THERE WAS A CARBUNCLE WHICH GLOWED LIKE FIFTY TORCHES
WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE KING WAS STANDING OUT ON THE STEPS AND HOW HE DID STARE AT THE MAN WHO CAME RIDING UP
NOW COME ALONG WITH ME I AM AFRAID PRINCE IVAN
WHEN THE SERMON WAS OVER AND SHE WENT OUT OF THE CHURCH AND WAS JUST GOING TO MOUNT HER HORSE THE PRINCE AGAIN CAME AND ASKED HER WHERE SHE CAME FROM
BUT I MUST HAVE A GOOD STABLE AND MOST EXCELLENT FODDER FOR MY HORSE SAID HE
TAKE THIS PRETTY DRESS AND LET US SEE THE DIFFERENCE IT WILL MAKE SO DELICIA TOOK OFF THE UGLY CAP AND SHOOK OUT ALL HER FAIR SHINING HAIR AND BATHED HER HANDS AND FACE IN CLEAR WATER FROM THE NEAREST SPRING TILL HER CHEEKS WERE LIKE ROSES AND WHEN SHE WAS ADORNED WITH THE DIAMONDS AND THE SPLENDID ROBE THE FAIRY HAD GIVEN HER SHE LOOKED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN THE WORLD AND THE FAIRY WITH GREAT DELIGHT CRIED
SO THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SWEET HAY AND OATS AND AS MUCH OF THEM AS THE DAPPLED HORSE CHOSE TO HAVE AND ALL THE OTHER RIDERS HAD TO TAKE THEIR HORSES OUT OF THE STABLE THAT DAPPLEGRIM MIGHT STAND ALONE AND REALLY HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM
BUT AT LAST HE GREW TIRED OF LIVING ALONE AND MARRIED A QUEEN WHO WAS A WIDOW AND SHE ALSO HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WAS JUST AS ILL-FAVOURED AND WICKED AS THE OTHER WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL
CAN YOUR DAUGHTER THE MOON TELL ME WHERE MY HUSBAND IS SHE CANNOT TELL YOU THAT MY CHILD REPLIED THE GODDESS BUT IF YOU WILL TRAVEL TOWARDS THE EAST UNTIL YOU REACH THE DWELLING OF THE SUN HE MAY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THEN SHE GAVE THE PRINCESS A ROAST CHICKEN TO EAT AND WARNED HER TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE ANY OF THE BONES BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE OF GREAT USE TO HER
INDEED PRINCESS REPLIED FLORIMOND IT IS YOURSELF BUT YOU MUST HAVE A NEW NAME SINCE THE OLD ONE DOES NOT SUIT YOU NOW
SO HE TOOK UP SOME WATER IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND HELD IT TO ITS BEAK
BUT AFTER THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR SEEING THAT THEY NEVER EVEN DREAMED OF PAYING THE INTEREST HE BECAME UNEASY SO MUCH SO THAT AT LAST HE RESOLVED TO GO AND SEE HIS MAJESTY HIMSELF AND GET REPAID
THEN I TOO WILL CLIMB IT AND TRY MY LUCK SO ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT DUSK HE WENT TO THE FOOT OF THE TOWER AND CRIED
MY BROTHERS SAYS HE ARE NOW GOING TO TRAVEL AND AS I UNDERSTAND A PERILOUS JOURNEY WHEREIN THEY KNOW NOT WHAT ROAD TO TAKE OR WHAT MAY HAPPEN THEM
AND QUACK QUACK QUACK DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING
THE PLUNGING CONTINUED THUS WITHOUT CEASING TILL MIDNIGHT
MY DEAR FRIEND HOW BEAUTIFULLY YOU PLAY THE FIDDLE
HE DARED NOT ANSWER BUT ONLY SQUEEZED THE PRINCESS'S HAND UNTIL HE REALLY HURT HER LITTLE FINGER BUT SHE DID NOT CRY OUT
DARKNESS BEHIND ME BUT LIGHT ON MY WAY THAT THE PRINCE MAY NOT SEE WHERE I'M GOING TO-DAY AND SHE WAS GONE AGAIN NEITHER COULD THE PRINCE SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER
HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE SUCH NONSENSE
BUT AS SOON AS HE SET IT DOWN THE LITTLE MOUSE CAME AND ATE UP ALL THREE SO THAT WHEN THE QUEEN WANTED HER DINNER THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR HER
KARI BEGGED FOR LEAVE TO GO WITH IT BUT THE OTHERS REMINDED HER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED LAST TIME AND SCOLDED HER FOR WANTING TO LET THE PRINCE SEE HER WHEN SHE WAS SO BLACK AND SO UGLY IN HER WOODEN GOWN BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ASKING UNTIL THEY GAVE HER LEAVE TO GO UP TO THE PRINCE WITH THE COMB
SEE I WILL CUT THIS APPLE IN HALF
YOU HAVE A FINE FLOCK OF TURKEYS THERE THE YOUNG TURKEY-MAIDEN TURNED HER GENTLE EYES UPON THE OLD WOMAN AND ANSWERED
BUT HE DID NOT SLEEP AND IN THE MORNING COULD NOT MANAGE TO RISE
FOR A TIME SHE LOST ALL CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AGAIN SHE WAS LYING IN A LOVELY MEADOW WITH THE SUN SHINING BRIGHTLY OVERHEAD AND A THOUSAND FLOWERS BLOOMING AT HER FEET
THEN HE CALLED THE OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LITTLE LAMPS FULL ON THE BED AND WHEN THEY SAW SNOWDROP LYING THERE THEY NEARLY FELL DOWN WITH SURPRISE
AT FIRST SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE WEDDING AT ALL BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE FELT SHE WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY TILL SHE HAD SEEN THE YOUNG QUEEN
BUT THE YOUTH TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS HIS SISTER AND THAT HE HAD PAINTED HER AND THAT IF SHE WAS NOT PRETTIER THAN THE PICTURE SHE WAS AT ALL EVENTS NOT UGLIER
AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE NOT PLEASED HE SAID VERY SHARPLY
THERE MAY'ST THOU SEE THE KING COMING OUT TO MEET THEE SAID THE BROTHER POINTING TO THE SEA-SHORE
BUT FIRST WE MUST HAVE ONE MORE TRIAL JUST TO SEE IF THOU ART FATED TO HAVE HER
GIVE ME THE CHILD ANSWERED THE WIDOW WOMAN
DON'T TRY TO PRESS IT OPEN BUT OIL THE HINGES WITH THIS AND THE OLD MAN GAVE HIM A SMALL BOTTLE
THEIR MAJESTIES WERE AMUSED AT THEM FOR THINKING OF IT BUT DID NOT MAKE ANY REPLY AND SOON AFTER BOTH THE KING AND THE QUEEN WERE TAKEN ILL AND DIED ON THE SAME DAY
WHAT CAN YOU WANT WITH ME SO THE GUARDS TIED HER HANDS AND FEET WITH THICK ROPES FOR FEAR SHE MIGHT RUN AWAY AND BROUGHT HER TO THE KING WHO WAS WAITING WITH HIS SON
HER CHEEKS FLUSHED HER EYES SPARKLED AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE LOVED DANCING BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
I KNOW NO WAY OF RESCUING DELICIA FROM HER CLUTCHES WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS TERRIBLE NEWS SHE WAS HEART-BROKEN AND BEGGED THE FAIRY TO DO ALL SHE COULD TO GET THE POOR LITTLE PRINCESS BACK AGAIN
WHEN THE PRINCESS GREW SLEEPY TWENTY-FOUR CHARMING MAIDENS PUT HER TO BED IN THE PRETTIEST ROOM SHE HAD EVER SEEN AND THEN SANG TO HER SO SWEETLY THAT GRACIOSA'S DREAMS WERE ALL OF MERMAIDS AND COOL SEA WAVES AND CAVERNS IN WHICH SHE WANDERED WITH PERCINET
AND THE QUEEN ASKED FOR HER NECK-HANDKERCHIEF THAT SHE MIGHT LOOK SMART
AND WHEN SHE HAD COME TO ONE OF THEM AND WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM SOME MONEY SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RING WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN TO THE PRINCE IN THE OTHER WORLD AND HER SISTERS RINGS TOO--FOR IT REALLY WAS HE
SHE IS ONLY A LOW-BORN BEGGAR MAID THAT YOU HAVE MARRIED
THAT IS HIS USUAL COURSE
THEN IT SUDDENLY GREW TALL AND THE QUEEN RECOGNISED THE FAIRY WHO HAD COME WITH THE WICKED KING TO VISIT HER
AND NOW HE HAD TO RELATE EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND THE OLD WOMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIM THAT SHE WOULD TAKE HIM UP TO THE FARM AT ONCE TO SHOW HIM TO THE GIRLS WHO HAD FORMERLY LOOKED DOWN ON HIM SO
HE MUST NOT DO THAT FOR IF HE DOES WE SHALL HAVE NO MORE DELIGHT IN HIM THIS TIME
SHE HOWEVER REFUSED TO PART WITH IT BECAUSE SHE HAD INHERITED IT FROM HER MOTHER
AND SO IT WAS AS YOU WILL SEE
AT THE FEAST THE GIRL SAT NEXT HIM IN THE PLACE OF HONOUR AS SHE HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE
I'LL TAKE IT WITH ME TO-MORROW WHEN I GO TO DRIVE THE COWS TO THE WOOD
IS THAT ALL SAID THE KING AND HE WENT UP INTO THE GARRET AND BROUGHT HER DOWN MORE FLAX THAN SHE COULD SPIN IN A HUNDRED YEARS
WHEN THEY SAW SNOWDROP LYING DEAD ON THE GROUND THEY AT ONCE SUSPECTED THAT HER WICKED STEP-MOTHER HAD BEEN AT WORK AGAIN
EACH PRINCESS ENTERED ONE OF THE BOATS AND MICHAEL SLIPPED INTO THAT WHICH HELD THE YOUNGEST
DO YOU WANT TO MARRY A NEGRESS AND GIVE ME GRANDCHILDREN AS UGLY AS MONKEYS AND AS STUPID AS OWLS NO FATHER NOTHING OF THE SORT
WHEN I HEARD HIM SNORING AS I WAS I WENT UP AND CAUSED THE WOMAN TO BIND MY WOUND WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
PRINCESS ROSETTE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD TWO BEAUTIFUL SONS AND ONE LITTLE DAUGHTER WHO WAS SO PRETTY THAT NO ONE WHO SAW HER COULD HELP LOVING HER
MOST OF THEM WERE FAIR AND FAT AND CHARMING BUT THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS DARK-SKINNED AND UGLY AND SPOKE A STRANGE LANGUAGE WHICH NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND
I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU WILL FIND ME A MOST APT PUPIL SO THEY JOINED COMPANY AND WENT ON THEIR WAY TOGETHER AND AFTER A TIME THEY CAME TO AN OLD OAK TREE WHICH WAS HOLLOW AND HAD A CRACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRUNK
AT FIRST HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS EYES AND STARED AT THE LADDER OF BONES AND AT THE LITTLE FINGER ON THE TOP OF IT
HE SAW THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED HAD HAPPENED AND THAT A THOUSAND WORDS WOULD NOT ALTER MATTERS BY A HAIR'S-BREADTH
WHILE MINNIKIN WAS NOW STANDING THERE LOOKING ABOUT HIM HE CAST HIS EYE ON A LARGE CHEST
BEHAVE WELL AND LOOK AFTER EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE
YOU SHALL SUFFER FOR YOUR FOOLHARDINESS OH HE IMPLORED PARDON MY PRESUMPTION
UPON THIS THE KING STAMPED UPON THE GROUND AND CRIED IN A TERRIBLE VOICE
THERE HE GATHERED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORANGES HE COULD FIND AND TURNED TO GO BACK TO THE GATE
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT THE ORIGINAL OF WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF ALL MY MISFORTUNES AND IF YOU WISH TO HELP ME GO WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TO THE GREAT GALLERY NOTICE WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS FALL MOST BRIGHTLY AND IF YOU SEEK THERE YOU WILL FIND MY TREASURE THE VOICE CEASED AND THOUGH THE PRINCE IN HIS BEWILDERMENT ASKED VARIOUS QUESTIONS HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
THIS EVENING HE CAME AS USUAL AND RENELDE TOLD HIM WHAT BURCHARD HAD SAID
I AM QUITE DONE ENOUGH BUT THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING GIRL ANSWERED
BUT TIME PASSED AND IT GREW LATER AND LATER AND STILL THE MAN DID NOT COME BACK AND AT LAST THE GOVERNOR GREW SO WEARY OF KEEPING HIS FINGER IN THE TAP-HOLE THAT HE TOOK IT OUT
IN THE POULTRY YARD FANCY HOW VEXED DRAKESTAIL WAS
SO THEY TOLD THE YOUTH THAT IF HE COULD TAKE THIS OX ALSO WITHOUT THE MAN KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND WITHOUT DOING HIM ANY HURT HE SHOULD THEN BE ON AN EQUALITY WITH THEM
THE YOUNG PRINCES WERE NOT IN THE LEAST CONCERNED NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY HAD TO DO
SHE ACTUALLY WANTED TO CLAIM AUTHORITY OVER YOU FOR EVER BECAUSE YOU CAME OUT OF THE TOWER FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE TWENTY YEARS WERE ENDED
IT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR YOU TO SLEEP HERE SAID THE OLD HAG FOR IF THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE COME HOME AND FIND YOU THEY WILL KILL BOTH YOU AND ME WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE THEY THEN WHO DWELL HERE SAID THE YOUTH
DON'T CRY DEAR MOTHER
I AM NOT QUITE CERTAIN SAID THE MAN BUT I THINK I CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING FAR FAR AWAY THEN WE SHALL DO WELL TO FLY ON A LITTLE FARTHER SAID THE EAGLE AND IT SET OFF AGAIN
WE CAN'T BE TOO MANY FRIENDS
WE OURSELVES COULD REFUSE YOU ALL PAYMENT
BUT HEARING THE BIRDS CHIRPING TO THEIR MATES AMONG THE TREES MADE HER THINK WITH LONGING OF HER HUSBAND AND SHE WEPT BITTERLY AND TAKING HER CHILD IN HER ARMS AND HER BUNDLE OF CHICKEN BONES ON HER SHOULDER SHE ENTERED THE WOOD
AT THE FIRST BLOW ALL THE RAGGED GARMENTS WHICH HE HAD WORN IN THE KITCHEN FELL FROM OFF MINNIKIN AT THE SECOND BLOW THE BRASS GARMENTS FELL OFF AND AT THE THIRD THE SILVER RAIMENT AND THERE HE STOOD IN THE GOLDEN RAIMENT WHICH WAS SO BRIGHT AND SPLENDID THAT LIGHT FLASHED FROM IT
AS SOON AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO DO SO THE THREE LITTLE MEN CONSULTED WHAT THEY SHOULD GIVE HER AS A REWARD FOR BEING SO SWEET AND GOOD AND FOR SHARING HER LAST CRUST WITH THEM
THE PRINCE AROSE WENT OUT OF THE CITY INTO THE FIELDS TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET THE EGGS WHICH THE MAIDENS HAD GIVEN HIM AND AS THEY HAD TAUGHT HIM TURNED THEM INTO THREE PALACES
THEN THEY DRESSED HIM SO SPLENDIDLY THAT HE WAS LIKE A KING'S SON
THEN SIGURD CAME AND TRIED TO COMFORT HER BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN AND SAID SHE WISHED THE SWORD STOOD FAST IN HIS HEART
PRINCESS SAID HE FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS HAS A WICKED ENCHANTER KEPT ME HERE
HE CAME FROM THE FIVE FAIRIES AND BROUGHT FOR THE PRINCESS A CROWN A SCEPTRE AND A ROBE OF GOLDEN BROCADE WITH A PETTICOAT MARVELLOUSLY EMBROIDERED WITH BUTTERFLIES WINGS
AND TO SATISFY THE BIRD HE TOOK A SECOND ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITHOUT THINKING WHAT HE WAS DOING
THAT IS THE WIFE I WANT AND I AM GOING TO LOOK FOR HER THE LORD OF AVESNES WAS SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT HE LET HIS PIPE FALL TO THE GROUND
THE POMEGRANATES WERE GARNETS THE MARIGOLDS TOPAZES THE DAFFODILS YELLOW DIAMONDS THE VIOLETS SAPPHIRES THE CORN-FLOWERS TURQUOISES THE TULIPS AMETHYSTS OPALS AND DIAMONDS SO THAT THE GARDEN BORDERS BLAZED LIKE THE SUN
THESE GOOD PEOPLE HAD A LITTLE WINDOW AT THE BACK OF THEIR HOUSE WHICH LOOKED INTO THE MOST LOVELY GARDEN FULL OF ALL MANNER OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES
ONE DAY THE TWO AT HOME PREPARED A FINE FEAST AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL ASSEMBLED THEY SAT DOWN AND ATE AND DRANK AND MADE MERRY
WHEN HE REACHED THE FOREST HE MET A LITTLE OLD GREY MAN WHO WISHED HIM GOOD-MORNING AND SAID
AND AT LAST SHE GOT LEAVE AND THEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE AS HAD BEEN AGREED ON BETWEEN THE PRINCESS AND MINNIKIN
WHAT IS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR FLASK OLD WOMAN ASKED ONE OF THE STABLE BOYS
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING THUS MY PRETTY ONE WITH YOUR LITTLE BASKET ON YOUR ARM I AM GOING TO MY GRANDMOTHER TO TAKE HER A GOOD PIECE OF CAKE FOR HER SUNDAY TREAT TO-MORROW AND WHERE DOES SHE LIVE YOUR GRANDMOTHER SHE LIVES AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WOOD IN THE FIRST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE NEAR THE WINDMILL YOU KNOW AH
WHEN THE APPLE WAS QUITE FINISHED SHE STAINED HER FACE AND DRESSED HERSELF UP AS A PEASANT AND SO SHE WENT OVER THE SEVEN HILLS TO THE SEVEN DWARFS SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AS USUAL BUT SNOWDROP PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND CALLED OUT
ONE OF THEM WAS PRETTY AND CLEVER AND THE OTHER UGLY AND LAZY
SHE DYED HER RED HAIR BLACK AND PAINTED HER FACE
IT WAS NOT HER FAULT THAT HER MOTHER WAS A WITCH
AND WHEN HE HAD GOT VERY NEAR HOME AND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE HIS FATHER LIVED HE PUT ON A UNIFORM WHICH HE HAD FOUND AMONG THE THINGS HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE ROBBERS AND WHICH WAS MADE JUST LIKE A GENERAL'S AND DROVE INTO THE YARD JUST AS IF HE WERE A GREAT MAN
AND I COULD NOT DRAW MY SWORD UPON A WOMAN
WHEN THEY WERE WELL OUT OF THE HOUSE THE FIRST THING THAT HE DID WAS TO DRIVE THE OXEN OUT ON THE ROAD WHEREUPON THEY ALL RAN HOME AGAIN TO THE MAN FROM WHOM HE HAD STOLEN THEM AND RIGHT GLAD WAS THE HUSBANDMAN TO SEE THEM
BUT DESIRE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS IN HER HEART SO HE DID NOT ANSWER
SO WHEN THE YOUTH GOT HOME AGAIN HE TOO RELATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE TOO SAID THAT HE HAD GONE OUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE ONCE BUT THAT NEVER WOULD HE DO IT AGAIN
STOP HER
SOON FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CELLARS THE TOP OF THE GARRETS FROM UNDER ALL THE FURNITURE FROM ALL THE NOOKS AND CORNERS OF THE HOUSES OUT COME THE RATS SEARCH FOR THE DOOR FLING THEMSELVES INTO THE STREET AND TRIP TRIP TRIP BEGIN TO RUN IN FILE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE TOWN HALL SO SQUEEZED TOGETHER THAT THEY COVERED THE PAVEMENT LIKE THE WAVES OF FLOODED TORRENT
WE WANT TO LOAD THE CART WITH OUR WALNUTS BUT WE CAN'T MANAGE TO DO IT THE LOVER ADVISED THEM TO GET A BASKET AND TO PUT THE WALNUTS IN IT SO AS TO TURN THEM INTO THE CART
THAT'S A BRAVE SHOE SAID HE
WHEN THE KITCHEN-MAID CAUGHT SIGHT OF ALL THIS GOLD AND SILVER SHE WAS QUITE AMAZED AND SAID
THEN THE QUEEN WAS VERY ANGRY AND GAVE THE NURSE AND THE CRADLE-ROCKER AND THE NURSERY-MAID SUCH A SCOLDING THAT THEY SHOOK IN THEIR SHOES
WHEN HE GOT THERE HE DID WHAT THE FOALS HAD BIDDEN HIM AND CUT OFF THE HEADS OF ALL THE SEVEN
FANFARONADE BEING ONCE MORE LEFT WITH THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO THINK THAT IF HE COULD GET RID OF HER AND POSSESS HIMSELF OF THE CARBUNCLE AND THE DAGGER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
SOME WAY FARTHER ALONG THE ROAD HE CAME UPON A MAN WHO HAD NEVER WORN ANY TROUSERS AND WHO WAS TRYING TO PUT ON A PAIR
HE ADDED THAT THE INHABITANTS SHOULD AT THAT HOUR LEAVE THE STREETS FREE AND CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH LOOKING OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS AT WHAT WAS PASSING AND THAT IT WOULD BE A PLEASANT SPECTACLE
FOLLOW THE WALL TILL YOU COME TO A HEAVY IRON GATE
JUST AT THIS LUCKY MOMENT WHO SHOULD ARRIVE BUT KING MERLIN'S SON WHO HAD BECOME UNEASY AT NOT RECEIVING ANY NEWS FROM HIS AMBASSADOR AND SO HAD STARTED HIMSELF WITH A MAGNIFICENT ESCORT OF A THOUSAND HORSEMEN AND THIRTY BODY-GUARDS IN GOLD AND SCARLET UNIFORMS TO SEE WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
WHAT ART THOU STUMBLING FOR SORRY JADE
THEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND ASKED IF HE COULD FIND A LODGING THERE
YOU POOR THING
AS HE WAS NOT VERY BRAVE HE ACCEPTED HER AID GLADLY
YES AND YOU WILL HEAR IT AGAIN VERY SOON SAID DAPPLEGRIM
HE SEEMED IN A DESPERATE CONDITION BUT HE GOT NEITHER BETTER NOR WORSE
I DECLARE I SMELL A SAVOURY DINNER WHY YES MADAM HERE IT IS SAID JACK-THE-CHATTERER HOLDING UP THE SPIT WHERE ALL THE PHEASANTS AND PARTRIDGES WERE FRIZZLING
THEN THE DRAGON LASHED WITH HIS TAIL TILL STONES BROKE AND TREES CRASHED ABOUT HIM
AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE COURTYARD THE OLD HEN WHO SAT ON THE TOP OF THE WALL CALLED OUT
AT LAST WEARIED WITH HER LONG JOURNEY AND WORN OUT AND OVERCOME WITH SORROW BUT STILL WITH HOPE AT HER HEART SHE REACHED A HOUSE
THESE SHE PLACED AGAINST THE WALL AT A DISTANCE OF A YARD FROM ONE ANOTHER
AND NOW THOU MUST TAKE THE SWORD AWAY WITH THEE AND WITH IT SHALT THOU CUT OFF THE HEADS OF ALL SEVEN OF US ON THY WEDDING-DAY AND THEN WE SHALL BECOME PRINCES AGAIN AS WE WERE BEFORE
AFTER A TIME A WOLF CAME THROUGH THE THICKET AND TROTTED UP TO THE MUSICIAN
AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE ROPE WAS THE PRINCE TOOK HOLD OF IT AND MADE THE MAIDENS FAST TO IT
THIS FOREST WAS SO GLOOMY AND SO FULL OF LIONS TIGERS BEARS AND WOLVES THAT NOBODY DARED PASS THROUGH IT EVEN BY DAYLIGHT AND HERE THEY SET DOWN THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLACK NIGHT AND LEFT HER IN SPITE OF ALL HER TEARS AND ENTREATIES
HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT HE WAS VERY WELL OFF AT HOME AND THAT HE WAS WELCOME TO STAY WITH THEM
THEN THE MARE PULLED A LITTLE FORWARD AGAIN AND IT MOVED WITH SUCH DIFFICULTY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA THAT THIS WAS THE MASTER THIEF
THEY CROSSED AGAIN THE WOOD WITH THE DIAMOND-SPANGLED LEAVES THE WOOD WITH GOLD-SPRINKLED LEAVES AND THE WOOD WHOSE LEAVES GLITTERED WITH DROPS OF SILVER AND AS A PROOF OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN THE BOY BROKE A SMALL BRANCH FROM A TREE IN THE LAST WOOD
THE TRUE HISTORY OF LITTLE GOLDEN HOOD YOU KNOW THE TALE OF POOR LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD THAT THE WOLF DECEIVED AND DEVOURED WITH HER CAKE HER LITTLE BUTTER CAN AND HER GRANDMOTHER
THIS TIME IT WAS A DISH OF MILK SHE POURED UPON THE ASHES SAYING
BUT NOW THE CHILD GREW RESTLESS AND CRIED BECAUSE IT MISSED ITS MOTHER'S CARE
AS HE HAD A WHITE SKIN BLUE EYES AND HAIR THAT CURLED ALL OVER HIS HEAD THE VILLAGE GIRLS USED TO CRY AFTER HIM WELL STAR GAZER WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND MICHAEL WOULD ANSWER OH NOTHING AND GO ON HIS WAY WITHOUT EVEN TURNING TO LOOK AT THEM
IT IS LONELY ENOUGH AND TOO FAR OFF FOR ANYONE TO FOLLOW US THERE SO SHE ORDERED THE OLD BOATMAN TO STEER FOR SQUIRREL ISLAND
BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER SHE MADE A SUDDEN DASH FOR ONE OF THE DOORS OPENED IT AND DARTED OUT FOLLOWED BY HER HUSBAND
BY THIS TIME IT HAD GROWN DARK AND THE PRINCE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN ROOM AND TO AMUSE HIMSELF HE TOOK UP A QUAINT OLD BOOK AND BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES
BUT RENELDE ROSE TO THE SURFACE AND THOUGH SHE COULD NOT SWIM SHE STRUGGLED TO LAND
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THEY WENT TO BALLS OR TO THE OPERA
THEN SHE WENT AWAY AND MOUNTED HER HORSE AGAIN
POOR AND WRETCHED ONE AND ALL
CERTAINLY I DO I CAN TELL YOU HOW TO GET A BAG OF GOLD SAID SHE
BUT JUST AS SHE GOT NEAR THE TOP SHE NOTICED THAT THERE WERE NO BONES LEFT FOR THE LAST RUNG OF THE LADDER
AND NOW SAID HE AFTER THE CEREMONY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET'S GO TO SUPPER
BUT AT LEAST I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOT HIDE ANYTHING FROM ME SO AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PERSUASION THEY SAID
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
SO AS HE HAD NOW BEEN WALKING THE WHOLE DAY AND HAD NOT BROUGHT ANYTHING TO EAT AWAY WITH HIM HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY
NOW SAYS HE THIS TIME I WILL FORGIVE YOU IN RETURN FOR YOUR KINDNESS IN GIVING ME WATER TO DRINK
YOU MAY HANG THERE FOR ME
RATHER THAN LET YOUR WIFE DIE YOU SHALL FETCH HER SOME RAMPION NO MATTER THE COST SO AT DUSK HE CLIMBED OVER THE WALL INTO THE WITCH'S GARDEN AND HASTILY GATHERING A HANDFUL OF RAMPION LEAVES HE RETURNED WITH THEM TO HIS WIFE
RENELDE WADED THE FORD RETURNED TO THE HUT AND SAT DOWN TO SPIN
BUT IF THEY HAD NEXT TO NOTHING OF ALL ELSE THEY HAD THE BLESSING OF GOD SO FAR AS CHILDREN WERE CONCERNED AND EVERY YEAR BROUGHT THEM ONE MORE
AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH HE GRUMBLED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THAT THE BOY SHOULD PICK UP A HAG WITHOUT A PENNY BUT THE GOOSE MUST GO AND BURN NOW
SHE KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT HIM SHE SAID BUT SHE GOVERNED ALL THE BIRDS
AND THEY PUT A RING ON HIS FINGER AND IT WAS ONE WHICH WOULD ENABLE HIM TO GO THERE AND BACK AGAIN BY WISHING BUT THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST NOT THROW IT AWAY OR NAME THEIR NAMES
SO SHE LEAPED INTO THE SEA
MINNIKIN STOLE IT
SO THE MAN CAME WITH HIS OX AND WHEN HE SAW THE BODY HANGING THERE HE FELT A LITTLE QUEER
THEREUPON IN SPITE OF THE KING'S ORDERS THE GUARDS GAVE HIM AN EXCELLENT SUPPER AND WHEN HE HAD EATEN IT HE AGAIN OPENED HIS BOOK BUT COULD SEE NONE OF THE WONDERFUL PICTURES WHICH CONVINCED HIM THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREAMING BEFORE
BUT THE FAIRY BADE HER TAKE COURAGE
BEWITCH MY KNIFE'S BLADE FOR ME AND I SHALL CHANGE YOU INTO A REINDEER OF THE FOREST ARE YOU THERE AGAIN TO BRING TROUBLE UPON ME SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN
WHEN THE YOUTH CAME DOWN AGAIN TO THE KING'S PALACE HE ASKED THE KING IF THE PRINCESS SHOULD NOT AT LAST BE HIS FOR NOW NO ONE COULD SAY THAT THE SUN WAS NOT SHINING INTO THE PALACE
BUT WHEN HE GOT HOME AT NIGHT AND HIS WIFE SHOWED HIM A BABY WHICH HAD JUST BEEN BORN AND FELL A-WEEPING AND WAILING WHEN HE TOLD HER OF THE PROMISE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HE WAS VERY UNHAPPY
THE NIGHT WAS EVEN WORSE
OF COURSE THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS TO LOOK AT HER OWN REFLECTION IN THE WATER AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE SHEPHERDESS SHE HAD SO MUCH ADMIRED AND WORE THE SAME WHITE DRESS AND FLOWERY WREATH THAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE PAINTED WINDOWS
LISTEN AND I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF THAT CASTLE
ONLY GO AND HIDE UNDER THAT TUB TILL OUR ELEVEN BROTHERS COME IN AND I'LL SOON MAKE MATTERS RIGHT WITH THEM SHE DID AS SHE WAS BID AND SOON THE OTHERS CAME HOME FROM THE CHASE AND SAT DOWN TO SUPPER
YOU ARE WELCOME QUEEN
NOW AS YOU KNOW SAID MINNIKIN WE ARE SO LIKE EACH OTHER THAT NO ONE CAN TELL ONE OF US FROM THE OTHER
PRESENTLY THERE MET HIM A LIONESS WITH HER CUB
ROUND THE HOUSE WERE SET TWELVE POLES IN A CIRCLE AND ON EACH OF ELEVEN OF THESE POLES WAS STUCK A HUMAN HEAD
SO FAIR MAIDENS AND UGLY MAIDENS CAME THITHER FROM ALL REGIONS BUT THERE WAS NONE WHO HAD A FOOT SO SMALL THAT SHE COULD PUT ON THE GOLD SHOE
HIS BODY WAS ALL ONE WOUND AND HE COULD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS TELL THE KING'S DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE HORN OF OINTMENT OUT OF THE TROLL'S BELT AND RUB HIM WITH IT
THESE PEOPLE ALSO DECLARED THAT THEY CAME FROM GERMANY BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW THEY CHANCED TO BE IN THIS STRANGE COUNTRY
NO SAID THE OLD WOMAN THAT I DO NOT BUT THE MOON WILL BE HERE PRESENTLY AND I WILL ASK HER AND SHE WILL KNOW
LET US DRINK TO YOUR TRIUMPH HE CAST A LINGERING GLANCE AT THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND WITHOUT HESITATION LIFTED THE CUP
SO SHE UNBARRED THE DOOR AND BOUGHT THE PRETTY LACE
HE FELT SURE HE WAS RIGHT
I'LL VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE IDLE MINX HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING AT ALL--SHE PREFERS TO SIT WITH HER HANDS BEFORE HER TO KEEP THEM WHITE BUT AS SOON AS SHE ENTERED GRACIOSA PRESENTED HER WITH THE BALL OF THREAD IN PERFECT ORDER SO THAT SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND AND COULD ONLY PRETEND TO DISCOVER THAT IT WAS SOILED FOR WHICH IMAGINARY FAULT SHE GAVE GRACIOSA A BLOW ON EACH CHEEK THAT MADE HER WHITE AND PINK SKIN TURN GREEN AND YELLOW
BY THE TIME THEY HAD FINISHED THE PEACOCK HAD COME BACK WITH A ROBE FOR THE PRINCESS IN WHICH THE FAIRY ARRAYED HER
BUT SHE SPOKE TO NO PURPOSE FOR HALVOR WOULD NOT GO
MIRROR MIRROR HANGING THERE WHO IN ALL THE LAND'S MOST FAIR AND THE MIRROR ANSWERED
THE QUEEN'S NECK-HANDKERCHIEF AND MY SWORD WHICH ARE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD ARE ALSO MISSING AND WHAT IS WORST OF ALL THE AMBASSADOR FANFARONADE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
SO THEY ALL WENT INTO THE CHURCH TOGETHER BUT THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY ONE WHO LISTENED TO WHAT THE PRIEST WAS SAYING FOR THEY WERE ALL LOOKING FAR TOO MUCH AT HER AND THE PRINCE FELL MUCH MORE DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HER THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
ADVISE ME THEN MY DEAR SUBJECTS WHAT HAD I BETTER DO TO RECOVER MY DAUGHTER FANFARONADE AND THE OTHER THINGS THIS WAS THE MOST ELOQUENT SPEECH THE KING HAD BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE AND WHEN EVERYBODY HAD DONE ADMIRING IT THE PRIME MINISTER MADE ANSWER
GO ABOUT EVERYWHERE KEEP WATCH OVER EVERYTHING
SHE DID HER BEST TO PLEASE THE OLD WOMAN AND SHOOK HER BED WITH SUCH A WILL THAT THE FEATHERS FLEW ABOUT LIKE SNOW-FLAKES
WELL SINCE YOU'VE DROPPED THE SPINDLE DOWN YOU MUST JUST GO AFTER IT YOURSELF AND DON'T LET ME SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN UNTIL YOU BRING IT WITH YOU THEN THE POOR GIRL RETURNED TO THE WELL AND NOT KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT IN THE DESPAIR AND MISERY OF HER HEART SHE SPRANG INTO THE WELL AND SANK TO THE BOTTOM
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU THAT YOU ARE MAKING ALL THIS DISTURBANCE THE PRINCE REPLIED
THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT SAID THE MASTER THIEF
HOW NICE IT WOULD BE TO BE AS PRETTY AS THAT AND THEN SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF IN A MIRROR AND TURNED AWAY QUICKLY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES FROM THE DOLEFUL SIGHT
I AM HERE SHRIEKED FARMER WEATHERBEARD RUSHING OUT OF DOORS
THE NEXT DAY HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A BROWN HORSE AND TOLD HIS FATHER THAT HE WAS TO SET OFF TO MARKET WITH HIM
THE PRINCESS'S TWENTY UNLUCKY YEARS WERE NOT QUITE OVER AND REALLY IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD I NOTICED THAT FANFARONADE AND THE PRINCESS APPEARED TO ADMIRE ONE ANOTHER GREATLY
HE WENT HOME AND TOOK THE OX WITHOUT HIS WIFE'S KNOWING ABOUT IT AND WENT ON HIS WAY TO THE TOWN WITH IT
DOWN FLEW THE RAVEN FROM THE OAK SMOTE UPON THE GROUND TURNED INTO A BRAVE YOUTH AND CRIED ALOUD
BUT FOR THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER ONLY WATER TO WASH IN AND ONLY WATER TO DRINK
THE WITCH GOT READY TO GO TOO
THINKING HE MIGHT BELONG TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE DUCHESS SHE SAID
BUT SHE STRUGGLED ON TILL SHE HAD PASSED THESE DREARY PLAINS
IN THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS JOY HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FILL IT
BUT ALL WENT WITH HIM AS IT HAD GONE WITH HIS BROTHER
LASTLY YOU WILL FIND A WELL ON YOUR LEFT
LACES OF EVERY SHADE AND DESCRIPTION AND SHE HELD ONE UP THAT WAS MADE OF SOME GAY COLOURED SILK
I WILL SAYS HE BUT WITH YOUR BATTALION TO DRAG ALONG YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED
SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE THE HEN WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM RICH ONCE MORE
SCARCELY HAD THE CANARY DRUNK WHEN SHE BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GIRL TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A POPLAR TREE WITH BLACK EYES AND A GOLDEN SKIN
AS SOON AS IT WAS NIGHT HE TOOK HIS WEAPONS AND SET OUT
SO HE HAD FASTENED THEM TO A TREE AND WAS JUMPING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT UP IN THE AIR SO THAT HE SHOULD HIT THE TWO LEGS OF THE TROUSERS AS HE CAME DOWN
FANFARONADE ASKED THE PRINCESS WHERE SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO BUT SHE ONLY ANSWERED THAT SHE DID NOT CARE WHERE SHE WENT AS LONG AS HE WAS WITH HER
SINCE YOU ARE GOING FAR AWAY TO-MORROW AND I SHALL NOT SEE YOU AGAIN LET ME COMB YOUR HEAD FOR THE LAST TIME AS A REMEMBRANCE OF YOU GOOD
IT IS JUST AS MUCH MINE AS YOURS WE SHALL HAVE A TUSSLE FOR THAT SCREAMED THE TROLL
THIS LASTED FOR A WHILE AND THEN THEY CAME UPON THE FELLS
FULL OF ANGER HE HURRIED AFTER THE MUSICIAN DETERMINED WHEN HE MET HIM TO TEAR HIM TO PIECES
WHAT AILS YOU DEAR WIFE OH SHE ANSWERED IF I DON'T GET SOME RAMPION TO EAT OUT OF THE GARDEN BEHIND THE HOUSE I KNOW I SHALL DIE THE MAN WHO LOVED HER DEARLY THOUGHT TO HIMSELF COME
SO HE ASKED THE KITCHEN-MAID WHAT THAT MEANT
I KNEW THAT AFTER TWO HUNDRED YEARS A PRINCE WOULD RECALL HER TO THE LIGHT OF DAY AND A PRINCESS IN RESTORING TO ME THE HAND WHICH MY ENEMY HAD CUT OFF WOULD GIVE ME BACK MY NATURAL FORM
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
GOOD-EVENING MOTHER SAID THE MAN
GOOD-EVENING MOTHER SAID THE MAN
GOOD-EVENING MOTHER SAID THE MAN
HE IS SURE TO CATCH US AND HEW YOU IN PIECES LET HIM HEW AWAY
IF YOU WILL PROCURE ME THE BEST SHOES FOR MY HORSE AND THE MOST MAGNIFICENT SADDLE AND BRIDLE THAT CAN BE FOUND SAID THE YOUTH YOU MAY HAVE ALL MY TWELVE MARES JUST AS THEY ARE STANDING OUT ON THE HILL AND THEIR TWELVE FOALS INTO THE BARGAIN FOR THIS YEAR ALSO EACH MARE HAD HER FOAL
THIS OFFER PRODUCED NO MORE EFFECT THAN THE OTHER AND RENELDE DID NOT GO TO THE CASTLE
BUT WHEN THE WOMAN HEARD THAT AND FOUND THAT THE MAN DID NOT AT ALL KNOW EITHER WHEN THEIR SON WOULD BE OUT OF HIS APPRENTICE-SHIP OR WHERE HE HAD GONE SHE PACKED HIM OFF AGAIN TO FIND OUT AND GAVE HIM A BAG OF FOOD AND A ROLL OF TOBACCO TO TAKE AWAY WITH HIM
SOON AFTER THE SECOND DAUGHTER CAME IN AND THOUGHT TO PLUCK A GOLDEN FEATHER FOR HERSELF TOO
THEN FEELING TIRED AND SLEEPY SHE LAY DOWN ON ONE OF THE BEDS BUT IT WASN'T COMFORTABLE
AND AS THEY PROCEEDED AT A STATELY PACE THE SKY BEGAN TO GROW DARK THEN SUDDENLY THE THUNDER GROWLED AND RAIN AND HAIL FELL IN TORRENTS
BUT STILL HE REMAINED SILENT
WHEN THE SATIN SLIPPERS WERE WORN THROUGH THE FIDDLES STOPPED AND THE NEGRO BOYS SET THE TABLE
THAT'S A REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE SAID MOTHER HOLLE AND SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER
AND SHE GATHERED THEM TOGETHER WITH HER WHISTLE
BUT SHE WAS SO UGLY AND LOOKED SO LOATHSOME THAT THE PRINCE WAS VERY UNWILLING TO DO WHAT HE HAD PROMISED
AND WHEN HE SOFTLY ADVANCED FEARING TO WAKE HER HE COULD HEAR HER SIGH AND MURMUR TO HERSELF
ONE PROMISED THAT SHE SHOULD BE PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL THE SECOND THAT SHE SHOULD UNDERSTAND ANYTHING--NO MATTER WHAT--THE FIRST TIME IT WAS EXPLAINED TO HER THE THIRD THAT SHE SHOULD SING LIKE A NIGHTINGALE THE FOURTH THAT SHE SHOULD SUCCEED IN EVERYTHING SHE UNDERTOOK AND THE FIFTH WAS OPENING HER MOUTH TO SPEAK WHEN A TREMENDOUS RUMBLING WAS HEARD IN THE CHIMNEY AND CARABOSSE ALL COVERED WITH SOOT CAME ROLLING DOWN CRYING
THEN THE FAIRY SHOWED HER ALL THE WONDERFUL DRESSES AND JEWELS SHE HAD BROUGHT FOR HER AND SAID
THE PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK WAS IMMENSELY ASTONISHED AT THIS UNJUST PROCEEDING AND SENT MANY MESSAGES OF REMONSTRANCE TO KING GRUMPY BUT HE WAS IN SUCH A TEMPER THAT NO ONE DARED TO DELIVER THEM OR TO SEND THE LETTERS WHICH THE PRINCESS WROTE TO HER FATHER
MY WEDDING SHIFT MY LORD YOU ARE GOING TO BE MARRIED THEN YES MY LORD BY YOUR LEAVE FOR AT THAT TIME NO PEASANT COULD MARRY WITHOUT THE LEAVE OF HIS MASTER
HE TOO WAS STANDING THERE HANGING HIS HEAD AND LOOKING SO DOWNCAST THAT SHE FELL A-WEEPING OVER HIM
I AM A KING'S SON
HE WILL NOT WAKEN FOR THAT THE MAN DID THIS
HAVING ENTERED INTO THE SERVICE OF THIS MASTER THE PRINCE BEGAN TO ASK WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THAT COUNTRY
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE ME HERE THAT IS CLEAR
I WILL ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING SAYS THE PRINCE
THE LEAVES LOOKED SO FRESH AND GREEN THAT SHE LONGED TO EAT THEM
LET US SHAKE HANDS UPON THE BARGAIN SAID THE KING
BUT HOW COULD I BE SURE THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE LIKE OTHER MEN AND TIRE OF ME FROM THE MOMENT YOU WERE SURE I LOVED YOU AS SHE SPOKE SHE SUDDENLY SAW A LITTLE DOOR OPEN AND THE SUNSHINE BLAZED INTO THE DISMAL WELL
IT'S NOT TRUE THAT SHE IS LOVELY
NEVER MIND LET US MAKE HASTE AND GET THE WEDDING OVER BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE IS LOST AND THEN HE ASKED WHERE THE PRINCESS WAS
AND WHATSOEVER HAD BEEN LACKING TO HIM IN THE WAY OF HONOUR BEFORE WAS LACKING NO LONGER FOR THE KING DID NOT KNOW HOW TO EXALT HIM ENOUGH AND ALWAYS SET HIM ON HIS OWN RIGHT HAND AT TABLE
THEN THE STEPMOTHER LAID HER UGLY DAUGHTER IN THE QUEEN'S PLACE AND COVERED HER UP WITH THE CLOTHES SO THAT NOTHING OF HER WAS SEEN
BUT AS HE JUMPED OVER THE THRESHOLD THE HARP CALLED OUT
VERY WELL DEAR HUSBAND I SHALL DO WHAT YOU WISH AND REMAIN WHERE I AM SO HER HUSBAND BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND THAT SHE HAD THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND HAD GOT OVER HER MAD IMPULSE TO OBEY THE VOICE
VERY SOFTLY HE STOLE ACROSS THE ROOM AND PICKING UP THE HEN MADE HASTE TO QUIT THE APARTMENT
AS HE WAS FOLLOWING ON THE STEPS OF THE PRINCESS LINA HE CARELESSLY TROD ON HER DRESS
THE FURNACE WAS SOON HOT BUT THIS TIME DRAKESTAIL WAS NOT SO AFRAID
BUT ON THE EVENING OF THE DAY IN WHICH SHE HAD DRIVEN POOR RAPUNZEL AWAY THE WITCH FASTENED THE PLAITS ON TO A HOOK IN THE WINDOW AND WHEN THE PRINCE CAME AND CALLED OUT
HIS BROTHERS HOISTED THE STONE TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND THEN CUT THE ROPE
DO YOU NOT KNOW ME AGAIN THEN SAID THE YOUTH
BREATHE UPON THE YELLOW SIDE AND YOU WILL BECOME LIKE THE PRETTY SHEPHERDESS YOU SO MUCH ADMIRE AND YOU WILL HAVE WON THE LOVE OF THE HANDSOME SHEPHERD WHOSE PICTURE I HAVE ALREADY SEEN YOU STUDYING WITH INTEREST
YOUR PAINTERS MUST INDEED BE DILIGENT SHE SAID POINTING OUT THE LAST PICTURE TO THE PRINCE
IN ALL THE KING'S COURT NO SUCH HORSE IS TO BE FOUND
AT DAYBREAK JACK ROSE AND WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN
THEY WERE NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE AT ONE GROS A HEAD
AND THE PRINCE WAS FAR MORE IN LOVE THAN HE HAD BEEN ON EITHER OF THE FORMER OCCASIONS AND HE WAS MINDFUL OF NOTHING BUT OF LOOKING AT HER
WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS OWN PALACE GRACIOSA RAN OUT TO MEET HIM AND ASKED IF HE HAD HAD GOOD SPORT
RUMOUR WHISPERED OF THESE TREASURES
MARELLES THE GOLDEN BRANCH ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING WHO WAS SO MOROSE AND DISAGREEABLE THAT HE WAS FEARED BY ALL HIS SUBJECTS AND WITH GOOD REASON AS FOR THE MOST TRIFLING OFFENCES HE WOULD HAVE THEIR HEADS CUT OFF
LET THE POOR CREATURE LOOSE IN OUR BIT OF FENCED-IN PASTURE AND DON'T LET IT STAND THERE STARVING AT OUR VERY DOOR
HE HAD BEEN ABSENT TEN WHOLE YEARS BUT HE TOO KNEW NO MORE THAN THE REST
HIS PARENTS SENT HIM AWAY TO LEARN SEVERAL THINGS BUT HALVOR STAYED NOWHERE FOR WHEN HE HAD BEEN GONE TWO OR THREE DAYS HE ALWAYS RAN AWAY FROM HIS MASTER HURRIED OFF HOME AND SAT DOWN IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER TO GRUB AMONG THE ASHES AGAIN
SHE IS AS GOOD AS SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND WE WILL GIVE HER A BUSHEL OF GOLD PIECES FOR HER DOWRY OH
THEREUPON HE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO DISQUIET HIMSELF AND THEN HE SAT DOWN UPON A STONE AND WENT TO SLEEP
THE PRINCE TOOK THE HINT AND LIFTING ASIDE THE PICTURE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FOUND HIMSELF IN A MARBLE HALL ADORNED WITH STATUES
THE SCULLION STOPPED AT ONCE JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WRING THE CANARY'S NECK
DULLHEAD DID NOT WAIT TO CONSIDER LONG BUT WENT STRAIGHT OFF TO THE FOREST AND THERE ON THE SAME SPOT SAT A MAN WHO WAS DRAWING IN A STRAP AS TIGHT AS HE COULD ROUND HIS BODY AND MAKING A MOST WOEFUL FACE THE WHILE
BUT BEFORE HE WENT AGAINST THE DRAGON HE LED AN ARMY TO FIGHT THE MEN WHO HAD KILLED HIS FATHER AND HE SLEW THEIR KING AND TOOK ALL HIS WEALTH AND WENT HOME
THEN HER LADIES PUT THE LITTLE PRINCESS INTO HER ARMS AND COVERED HER UP HEAD AND ALL IN THE BEDCLOTHES AND RAN FOR THEIR LIVES AND THE POOR QUEEN LAY THERE SHAKING AND HOPING SHE WOULD NOT BE FOUND
AT LAST THE PRIME MINISTER BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT THE KING WOULD BE STARVED TO DEATH SO HE RESOLVED TO HIDE HIMSELF IN SOME DARK CORNER OF THE KITCHEN AND NEVER TAKE HIS EYES OFF THE COOKING-POT
WILL YOU BELIEVE IT
WHEN HE WAS SEARCHED THEY FOUND THE GOLD PIECES IN HIS POCKET AND AS THEY WERE QUITE NEW COINS STRUCK IN HONOUR OF THE PRINCESS'S WEDDING THE ADMIRAL FELT CERTAIN THAT THE BOATMAN MUST HAVE BEEN PAID BY THE PRINCESS TO AID HER IN HER FLIGHT
WELL SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE ANOTHER SISTER
HE JUMPED LIGHTLY ON HIS HORSE AND WAS A MILE FROM HOME BEFORE TUBBY HAD CEASED LAUGHING
SO SHE SAID
I CAN SIT DOWN ON THE HEARTH THEY COULD SAY NOTHING AGAINST THAT SO HALVOR SAT DOWN ON THE HEARTH AND BEGAN TO RAKE ABOUT AMONG THE ASHES JUST AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE WHEN HE LAY THERE IDLING AWAY HIS TIME
YOU MAY TELL HIM FROM ME THAT HE MUST FIRST GIVE ME SOME PROOF OF THIS
IT IS ALL BECAUSE OUR TURKEY-MAIDEN WILL NOT LOVE ME WON'T LOVE YOU
WITH WHAT EAGERNESS SHE DANCED
BUT JUST CUT A HOLE IN THE CORN SACKS AND THEN THEY WILL BE SO BUSY WITH THE CORN THAT THEY WILL FORGET US THE YOUTH DID IT
IMMEDIATELY THE WITCH BEGAN TO MOCK HER SAYING
THEN WRAPPING HERSELF UP IN HER BLANKETS SHE DAINTILY PICKED HER WAY UP TO THE COTTAGE ON HER LITTLE BARE FEET
OH DEAR LITTLE MOTHER THEY ARE GOING TO SLAUGHTER YOU WELL THEN IF THEY DO SLAUGHTER ME WAS THE BLACK SHEEP'S ANSWER EAT YOU NEITHER THE MEAT NOR THE BROTH THAT IS MADE OF ME BUT GATHER ALL MY BONES AND BURY THEM BY THE EDGE OF THE FIELD SHORTLY AFTER THIS THEY TOOK THE BLACK SHEEP FROM THE FLOCK AND SLAUGHTERED IT
STILL NO ONE CAME
BUT ALL AT ONCE IT CAME INTO HIS HEAD TO GO HOME AND GET THE OTHER OX AND DRIVE IT TO THE TOWN AND TAKE GOOD CARE THAT HIS OLD WIFE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
GRACIOUS
AS SHE ENTERED SNOWDROP RECOGNISED HER AND NEARLY FAINTED WITH FEAR
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN AS TALL AS A GIRL OF FIFTEEN SAY TO EACH OF THEM MY BEAUTIFUL LAUREL WITH THE GOLDEN RAKE I HAVE RAKED YOU WITH THE GOLDEN BUCKET I HAVE WATERED YOU WITH THE SILKEN TOWEL I HAVE WIPED YOU THEN AFTER THAT ASK ANYTHING YOU CHOOSE AND THE LAURELS WILL GIVE IT TO YOU MICHAEL THANKED THE LADY IN THE GOLDEN DRESS AND WHEN HE WOKE HE FOUND THE TWO LAUREL BUSHES BESIDE HIM
THE PRINCESS BEGGED HIM VERY PRETTILY TO GO LEST THE TROLL SHOULD DEVOUR HIM
OLD MAN SAID THE WITCH GET ON YOUR CLOTHES AS QUICK AS YOU CAN
FIRST HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A HORSE-FLY AND HID HIMSELF IN DAPPLEGRIM'S LEFT NOSTRIL
AS FOR HIMSELF HE THOUGHT THE OTHER HALF WAS QUITE ENOUGH
SHE GREW TALL AND STRAIGHT AND PRETTY WITH EYES LIKE SHINING STARS AND A SKIN AS WHITE AS MILK
THE WOMAN HATED HER STEPDAUGHTER FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART AND DID ALL SHE COULD TO MAKE HER LIFE MISERABLE
IF HE ASKS WHAT TRADE I FOLLOW YOU MAY SAY THAT I AM A MASTER THIEF SAID HE
HE HAS STRETCHED ME OUT IN THE SUN
ONCE MORE THE YOUTH DID JUST AS HE HAD DONE TWICE ALREADY
WELL GOOD-MORNING FRIEND DRAKESTAIL SAID COMRADE WASP'S-NEST WHERE ARE WE BOUND FOR SO SPRUCE AND FRESH I AM GOING TO THE KING FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH
ONE STEP FURTHER
AND THE WOLF OPENED HIS JAWS WIDE TO SWALLOW BLANCHETTE
BUT NO SOONER DID THEY BEGIN TO BEAT HER THAN SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT RELIEF THAT THE RODS HAD CHANGED TO BUNDLES OF PEACOCK'S FEATHERS AND THOUGH THE DUCHESS'S WOMEN WENT ON TILL THEY WERE SO TIRED THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER RAISE THEIR ARMS FROM THEIR SIDES YET SHE WAS NOT HURT IN THE LEAST
WHEN SHE RETURNED SHE BROUGHT WITH HER A SKEIN OF THREAD THREE TIMES AS BIG AS HERSELF
WHAT WAS SHE TO DO
WHAT WAS SHE TO DO
WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED THAT WE SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THIS
IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL TO TEACH THOSE ONE LOVES
STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG QUEEN'S BED SHE BEGAN TO TRY HER MAGIC ARTS UPON HER SAYING
CALLED TUBBY
I WATCHED HER HERDS FOR THREE DAYS WITHOUT LOSING A SINGLE MARE AND IN RETURN FOR THAT THE BABA YAGA GAVE ME A FOAL BUT HOW DID YOU GET ACROSS THE FIERY RIVER WHY I'VE A HANDKERCHIEF OF THIS KIND--WHEN I WAVE IT THRICE ON THE RIGHT HAND THERE SPRINGS UP A VERY LOFTY BRIDGE AND THE FIRE CANNOT REACH IT MARYA MOREVNA LISTENED TO ALL THIS AND REPEATED IT TO PRINCE IVAN AND SHE CARRIED OFF THE HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE IT TO HIM
THE PRINCE AGAIN FOLLOWED HER AND ASKED HER WHENCE SHE CAME
THE PALACE IS GONE YES HE ANSWERED MY PALACE IS A THING OF THE PAST
SHE DID NOT FORGET THE LITTLE ROE EITHER BUT WENT TO THE CORNER WHERE IT LAY AND GENTLY STROKED ITS BACK
AT THEIR APPROACH THE MOUNTAIN HAD OPENED A LITTLE AND THE BAGPIPER HAD GONE IN WITH THEM AFTER WHICH IT HAD CLOSED AGAIN
YOU ARE PLEASED TO JEST POPINJAY SAID THE QUEEN BUT IT WILL BE MY TURN SOON THE KING WAS SPEEDILY TOLD WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW THE PRINCESS WAS IN TERROR OF THE ANGRY QUEEN BUT HE ONLY SAID
BUT THE YOUTH AGAIN WENT DOWN TO THE STABLE TO DAPPLEGRIM AND TOLD HIM THAT THE PRINCESS HAD HIDDEN HERSELF AGAIN AND THAT HE HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER
I'VE EATEN UP A WHOLE OVEN FULL OF LOAVES BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THAT TO ANYONE WHO IS AS HUNGRY AS I AM
FOR THEY INSIST ON HAVING ALL THEIR WEDDING-CLOTHES MADE FOR THEM FIRST EXACTLY LIKE THOSE WHICH THEY USED TO HAVE IN THE OTHER WORLD AND THAT WITHOUT BEING MEASURED FOR THEM
THEY FOUGHT AND FOUGHT
OH PERCINET SHE CRIED WHAT HAS HAPPENED
SHE SHOWED THEM THE PEACOCK AND ASKED WHAT IT WAS AND THEY ANSWERED THAT IT WAS A BIRD WHICH PEOPLE SOMETIMES ATE
INTO THAT YOU MUST NOT ENTER FOR HARM WOULD BEFALL YOU YOU MAY KEEP YOUR MIND EASY FATHER THEY REPLIED
IN THE MEANTIME THE WOLF HAD PULLED AND BITTEN AND SCRATCHED AT THE STONE TILL AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS PAWS OUT
WE WOULDN'T PART WITH IT FOR ALL THE GOLD IN THE WORLD WELL THEN HE REPLIED GIVE IT TO ME BECAUSE I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT SNOWDROP
BUT A PRINCESS WAS STANDING AT A WINDOW IN THE KING'S PALACE WATCHING THE STRUGGLE
WELL THAT'S JUST WHERE I'M GOING
HO HO SHE LAUGHED TERRIBLY
OH DEAR HUNTSMAN SPARE MY LIFE AND I WILL PROMISE TO FLY FORTH INTO THE WIDE WOOD AND NEVER TO RETURN HOME AGAIN AND BECAUSE SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND PRETTY THE HUNTSMAN HAD PITY ON HER AND SAID
I WILL CHERISH AND LOVE IT AS MY DEAREST POSSESSION HE SPOKE SO SADLY THAT THE GOOD DWARFS HAD PITY ON HIM AND GAVE HIM THE COFFIN AND THE PRINCE MADE HIS SERVANTS BEAR IT AWAY ON THEIR SHOULDERS
SO JACK CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A GOLD RING AND SET HIMSELF ON THE PRINCESS'S FINGER AND FARMER WEATHERBEARD COULD NOT GET AT HIM THERE
THE FAIRY BADE THEM FOLLOW HER TO THE CASTLE AND THEY MARCHED THITHER IN A BODY AND JACK BLEW THE HORN AND DEMANDED ADMITTANCE
COURAGE MADAM
THIS TIME HE DID NOT CROSS IN LINA'S BOAT
SHE GAVE A SHRIEK OF ALARM AND FAINTED AWAY AND THEY HAD TO POUR TWO BARRELS OF EAU-DE-COLOGNE OVER HER BEFORE SHE RECOVERED
HUTETU
HUTETU
HUTETU
HUTETU
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE YOU LOVELY CREATURE SHE SAID TO ZIZI
XIII THE FEAST WAS EXCELLENT BUT DESIRE HARDLY TOUCHED ANYTHING
SO THEY WENT ON A GREAT DISTANCE FARTHER
THE POOR OLD KING QUITE TREMBLED BEFORE HER AND WHEN SHE DECLARED THAT GRACIOSA WAS NOT THE PRINCESS AT ALL BUT A WICKED IMPOSTOR AND THAT IF THE KING DID NOT GIVE HER UP AT ONCE SHE WOULD GO BACK TO HER OWN CASTLE AND NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN HE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY AND REALLY SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT GRACIOSA AFTER ALL
MEANWHILE THE DAY WAS BREAKING AND THE KING AND QUEEN AND ALL THE COURTIERS BEGAN TO WAKE UP AND RUB THEIR EYES AND THINK IT WAS TIME TO FINISH THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING
IN THE MEANTIME THE BULL TRAVELLED THROUGH MANY LANDS WITH THE KING'S DAUGHTER ON HIS BACK AND ONE DAY THEY CAME TO A GREAT COPPER-WOOD WHERE THE TREES AND THE BRANCHES AND THE LEAVES AND THE FLOWERS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WAS OF COPPER
THEN THE YOUTH PICKED UP THE SHOE AND HURRIED OFF AWAY THROUGH THE WOOD AS FAST AS HE WAS ABLE TO GET IN FRONT OF THE MAN AND THEN PUT THE SHOE IN THE ROAD BEFORE HIM AGAIN
IT WILL END BY GETTING ME SENT AWAY
YES I WILL KISS YOU SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE DID IT BUT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE WORST BIT OF WORK THAT SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE
WHEN THE PRINCESS PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE DOOR AND SAID THAT THE QUEEN HAD ORDERED HER TO PLACE THE BOX IN HER OWN ROOM THE GOVERNOR LAUGHED HEARTILY AT THE IDEA
MY ENEMY CANCALINE HAS STOLEN THE PRINCESS AWAY
IF HE IS FLEET OF FOOT HE CAN GO WITH ME OUT RAN HALVOR
THERE TRULY DID SHE MEET WITH A CRUEL DEATH
SHE ALMOST GAVE UP IN DESPAIR BUT MADE ONE LAST GREAT EFFORT AND SUDDENLY IN A THICKET SHE CAME UPON THE SORT OF HOUSE THAT THE MOTHER OF THE WIND HAD DESCRIBED
HE HELPED HER ALL DAY
HE FOUND THAT THE PICTURES SEEMED TO BE SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO APPEARED IN EVERY WINDOW AND THE PRINCE FANCYING THAT HE SAW IN THIS MAN SOME RESEMBLANCE TO HIMSELF BEGAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED
THEN THEY PLACED HER ON A BIER AND ALL THE SEVEN DWARFS SAT ROUND IT WEEPING AND SOBBING FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THEIR SHEEP WENT ASTRAY AND THEY SET OUT TO LOOK FOR IT AND SEARCHED AND SEARCHED EACH IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE WOOD
LINA TURNED AS SHE HEARD THE NOISE MADE BY THE BREAKING OF THE BRANCH
AND THE HARP PLAYED A MERRY TUNE
I'M BRINGING YOU A BIG PIECE OF CAKE FOR YOUR SUNDAY TREAT TO-MORROW PRESS YOUR FINGER ON THE LATCH THEN PUSH AND THE DOOR OPENS WHY YOU'VE GOT A COLD GRANNY SAID SHE COMING IN
THEN THROW DOWN THE SPLINTERS OF WOOD WHICH YOU TOOK FROM BENEATH THE GRAY STONE BY THE STABLE DOOR SAID THE EAGLE
GOOD SAID THE FOAL
THE PASSING BELL WAS RUNG AND HE LAY EXPECTING DEATH TO COME FOR HIM
SHALL WE FORSOOTH SUFFER DEATH FOR THE SAKE OF A WRETCHED GIRL
WHAT SMELLS OF SINGEING HERE ASKED THE YOUNG WOMAN AND LOOKING ROUND SHE SAW HER OWN HUSBAND
WELL THEN MY CHARMING ZIZI SAID THE YOUNG PRINCE WHO WAS LONGING TO MARRY HER LET US RIDE AWAY QUICKLY SO AS TO ESCAPE FROM THE WICKED WITCH BUT ZIZI WISHED TO KNOW WHERE HE MEANT TO TAKE HER
BUT A DAY OR TWO LATER HIS TUTOR SAID TO SIGURD THERE IS A GREAT TREASURE OF GOLD HIDDEN NOT FAR FROM HERE AND IT WOULD BECOME YOU TO WIN IT BUT SIGURD ANSWERED I HAVE HEARD STORIES OF THAT TREASURE AND I KNOW THAT THE DRAGON FAFNIR GUARDS IT AND HE IS SO HUGE AND WICKED THAT NO MAN DARES TO GO NEAR HIM HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM I AM NO COWARD SAYS SIGURD
SO WHEN THE YOUTH HAD BEEN THERE FOR THE SPACE OF A YEAR OR SO HE WANTED TO GO HOME AGAIN TO PAY HIS PARENTS A VISIT
THEN THEY HAD SUPPER TOGETHER AND LAY DOWN TO REST
SO HE BROUGHT HER A GOWN THAT WAS AS BRIGHT AS THE COPPER WOOD AND SHE GOT A HORSE AND SADDLE TOO FROM HIM
I AM FROM BATHLAND SAID KARI
NOW I SUPPOSE ALL IS LOST THE KING WAS SORRY TO HAVE FRIGHTENED HER SO MUCH AND PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD GO AND HOLD A COUNCIL AS TO WHAT WAS BEST TO BE DONE TO AVERT THE MISFORTUNES WHICH CARABOSSE CERTAINLY MEANT TO BRING UPON THE LITTLE PRINCESS
MAKE AN END OF THESE FINE SPEECHES MADAM
THE ROBBERS HAD HEARD OF THIS SO THEY TOLD THE YOUTH THAT IF HE WERE ABLE TO STEAL THE OX FROM HIM ON THE WAY WITHOUT HIS KNOWING AND WITHOUT DOING HIM ANY HARM HE SHOULD HAVE LEAVE TO BE THEIR SERVANT-MAN
THIS WAS WHERE THE WIND LIVED
AND AS THE GOOD OLD WOMAN WAS CONSIDERED SOMETHING OF A WITCH EVERYONE THOUGHT THE LITTLE HOOD RATHER BEWITCHED TOO
WHEN THEY WERE GOING AWAY THE OLDEST FAIRY SAID THAT THEY WERE OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO SHUT THE PRINCESS UP IN SOME PLACE WITH HER WAITING-WOMEN SO THAT SHE MIGHT NOT SEE ANYONE ELSE UNTIL SHE WAS TWENTY YEARS OLD
YOU SHALL NEVER BE A GARDENER'S WIFE THE LITTLE PRINCESS STARED AT HIM WITH A FRIGHTENED FACE AND HE LEFT HER WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
FINE WARES TO SELL FINE WARES TO SELL SNOWDROP PEEPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND CALLED OUT
TAKE THE BOX REPLIED THE VOICE AND HIDE IT UNDER YOUR PILLOW AND WHEN YOU SEE AN EAGLE GIVE IT TO HIM WITHOUT LOSING A MOMENT TERRIFIED AS THE PRINCESS WAS SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO OBEY AND HASTENED TO PUT BACK ALL THE OTHER PRECIOUS THINGS PRECISELY AS SHE HAD FOUND THEM
SIGURD BE NOT AFRAID SIGURD WIN THOU THE MAID FORTUNE IS KEEPING
HOW COLD IT IS SHE SAID SOBBING AND SHIVERING WITH COLD
THE PRINCE ENTERED BOLDLY INTO THE COURTYARD
AND WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE KING HE THOUGHT THE MAID LOOKED LIKE A QUEEN AND THE QUEEN LIKE A MAID
NEITHER CATS NOR DOGS NOR POISON NOR TRAPS NOR PRAYERS NOR CANDLES BURNT TO ALL THE SAINTS--NOTHING WOULD DO ANYTHING
IN THE MORNING THE BABA YAGA SAYS TO HIM
NEVER WAS A BRIDE SEEN IN SUCH A DISMAL PLIGHT
HER BONNET WAS HERE AND HER SHOES THERE HER FACE WAS SCRATCHED AND HER FINE CLOTHES WERE COVERED WITH MUD
BUT ONE DAY THE MAN WAS AT THE BARBER'S AS USUAL BEING SHAVED
IF YOU REALLY WISH TO BE OF USE TO ME YOU WILL COME AT THE TIME THAT I WILL APPOINT AND I WILL LET DOWN MY POOR LITTLE BABY IN A BASKET
YOU ARE WALKING AS IF FOR A WAGER BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE STAYED TO SEE YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER BEFORE YOU HURRIED OFF INTO THE WORLD SO THE ELDER STOOD STILL AND LOOKED BACK AND WHEN THE YOUNGER HAD GOT UP TO HIM AND HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS HIS BROTHER HE SAID
HOWEVER SHE SAID NOTHING TO HER SISTERS BUT AS SHE MET THE BOY BY ACCIDENT WHILE SHE WAS WALKING UNDER THE SHADE OF THE ELMS SHE SUDDENLY STOPPED AS IF TO SPEAK TO HIM
THERE A PRINCESS WAS SITTING WHO WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANYONE TO EQUAL HER
THE SEVEN FOALS THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A COUPLE OF POOR FOLKS WHO LIVED IN A WRETCHED HUT FAR AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE IN A WOOD
AFTER SOME TIME HAD GONE BY THE MAN MARRIED AGAIN AND HE CHOSE A WIDOW WITH ONE DAUGHTER WHO WAS UGLY AND WICKED AND HER MOTHER WAS UGLY AND WICKED TOO
SO THE CATS COULD ALWAYS SEE THE MICE BUT COULD NOT TOUCH THEM AND THE HUNGRY MICE WERE TORMENTED BY THE SIGHT AND SMELL OF THE DELICIOUS MORSELS WHICH THEY COULD NEVER SEIZE
DEAR SISTER THERE IS STILL A LITTLE DIFFICULTY FOR WE HAD ALL AGREED THAT ANY GIRL WE MET SHOULD DIE AT OUR HANDS BECAUSE IT WAS FOR THE SAKE OF A GIRL THAT WE HAD TO LEAVE OUR KINGDOM BUT SHE REPLIED I WILL GLADLY DIE IF BY THAT MEANS I CAN RESTORE MY TWELVE BROTHERS TO THEIR OWN NO HE ANSWERED THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT
OOF SCREAMED FARMER WEATHERBEARD
THIS TIME HE TOOK WITH HIM A ROPE AND PUT IT UNDER HIS ARMS AND TIED HIMSELF UP TO A TREE WHICH HUNG OVER THE ROAD THAT THE MAN WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
BUT HE DID NOT DO MUCH HARM TO THIS TROLL EITHER FOR WHEN THE TIME CAME WHEN THE TROLL MIGHT BE EXPECTED HE SAID AS HE HAD SAID BEFORE
BUT THE TASK IS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE AND FULL OF PERIL JACK
AS SOON AS THE AMBASSADOR ARRIVED AT THE PALACE THE QUEEN STARTED TO FETCH HER DAUGHTER
THE RAVEN SPRINKLED THEM WITH THE WATER OF DEATH--THE PIECES JOINED TOGETHER THE BODY BECAME WHOLE
BUT THE GRANDMOTHER LIVED IN ANOTHER VILLAGE AND THERE WAS A BIG WOOD TO CROSS BEFORE GETTING THERE
THAT DAY THERE WAS A BRANCH OF THE TREES IN HER BOUQUET
HE NEVER RAISED HIS EYES TO HER BUT NEARLY ALL DAY SHE FELT HIM AT HER SIDE WITHOUT EVER SEEING HIM
TELL HIM YOU WISH TO SEE THEM AND THAT IT IS FULL TIME FOR THEM TO BE LIBERATED AND THAT YOU WOULD BE DESIROUS HE WOULD BRING THEM TO THE COURT
FEARING LEST IT SHOULD BE A WOLF SHE HID HERSELF IN THE HOLLOW TRUNK OF A WILLOW TREE WHICH HUNG OVER THE FOUNTAIN
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM SAID THE MAN
THIS KINGDOM WAS VERY APPROPRIATELY CALLED THE LAND OF TEARS
THERE'S A BROOM FOR YOU GO AND CLEAR UP OUR BACK DOOR I'LL SEE MYSELF FURTHER SHE ANSWERED RUDELY
THEREUPON AWAY FLED THE BEAST AS BEFORE
THE QUEEN TOOK THEM AND BEGAN TO PLAIT THEM SAYING
AND AS HIS NEIGHBOURS THE LITTLE PEOPLE WERE VERY FRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM THEY BESTOWED ON HIM MANY EXCELLENT AND PRECIOUS GIFTS
BUT KARI SAID THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAN TO LOOK AT HER AND SHE NEVER CEASED BEGGING UNTIL SHE GOT LEAVE TO GO
SHE DIDN'T MAKE MOTHER HOLLE'S BED AS SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE AND NEVER SHOOK IT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FEATHERS FLY
WHEN SHE HEARD HOW HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS THEY WERE HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH ENVY AND HATRED AND SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO BRING SOME FRESH MISFORTUNE ON THEM
UPON THIS ADVENTURE YOUR FUTURE HAPPINESS DEPENDS WHAT AM I TO DO SAID THE PRINCESS TREMBLING
CAN YOU SPEAK SAID HE
THEN HE RODE TO WHERE MARYA MOREVNA WAS
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW SAID THE BULL
COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL DRINK TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT SO HE TOOK HIM TO THE KING'S CELLAR AND THE MAN SAT DOWN BEFORE THE HUGE CASKS AND DRANK AND DRANK TILL HE DRANK UP THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE CELLAR BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED
YES DILIGENTLY AND FAITHFULLY HAST THOU WATCHED SAID THE KING AND THOU SHALT HAVE THE PRINCESS AND HALF THE KINGDOM SO ALL WAS MADE READY FOR THE WEDDING AND THE KING SAID THAT IT WAS TO BE SO STATELY AND MAGNIFICENT THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR OF IT AND EVERYONE INQUIRE ABOUT IT
ONLY ON CONDITION THAT YOU PROMISE FAITHFULLY THAT THE FIRST GIRL WE MEET SHALL NOT BE KILLED SHE SHALL BE SPARED THEY PROMISED ONLY TELL US THE NEWS THEN BENJAMIN SAID
THE FAIRY TOUCHED EACH DOOR WITH HER WAND AND IT SPRANG OPEN INSTANTLY BUT THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH FORTY BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE PRINCESS WHO WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR LOOKING VERY DEJECTED
ONE WINTER'S DAY WHEN THERE WAS A HARD FROST AND MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY WERE COVERED WITH SNOW THE WOMAN MADE A DRESS OF PAPER AND CALLING THE GIRL TO HER SAID
KING GRUMPY WENT OUT TO MEET HER BUT WHEN HE SAW HER WITH A SKIN LIKE A TORTOISE'S HER THICK EYEBROWS MEETING ABOVE HER LARGE NOSE AND HER MOUTH FROM EAR TO EAR HE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT
WHO IS CALLING ME SAID THE PRIEST
MIRROR MIRROR HANGING THERE WHO IN ALL THE LAND'S MOST FAIR AND IT REPLIED AS BEFORE
MY THROAT IS UTTERLY DRIED UP THE PRINCE GAVE HIM A BUCKETFUL OF WATER
AND NOW HE THOUGHT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR THE TROLL TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT HE CAME PANTING FOR BREATH
AND AFTER THAT SIGURD WAS CALLED FAFNIR'S BANE AND DRAGONSLAYER
AND AT LAST THEY WENT TO THE KING HIMSELF AND BEGGED THAT HE TOO WOULD PEEP THROUGH THE KEY-HOLE AND SEE FOR HIMSELF WHAT THE YOUTH DID
THEN HE ENTERED THE GIANT'S ROOM AND SEIZED THE HARP AND RAN AWAY WITH IT
MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GET INTO MY THROAT--GO INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS FRIEND FOX
SO HE HAD FOUND HER THE SECOND TIME
ARISE PRINCE IVAN
ARISE PRINCE IVAN
COME TO ME SAID CINDERLAD AS HE PASSED BY JUMPING AND RUNNING AND KEEPING TIGHT HOLD OF ONE OF THE FOALS TAILS
BUT JUST AS SHE HAD THE STROKE DRAWN THAT WOULD TERMINATE MY FATE THE COCK CREW AND THE WITCHES DISAPPEARED HAVING RESUMED THEIR NATURAL SHAPES FOR FEAR OF BEING KNOWN AND I GOT SAFE OFF WITH MY BAGS OF GOLD
IT WOULD NOT GO DOWN INTO THE WELL AND THE GYPSY HAD TO TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE EVENT WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER ONE LEFT OF THE FATHERS MOTHERS BROTHERS OR SISTERS OF THAT DAY THERE ARRIVED ONE EVENING IN HAMEL SOME MERCHANTS OF BREMEN RETURNING FROM THE EAST WHO ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE CITIZENS
OFF SHE SET IN PURSUIT
THEN SHE WENT TO THE BIRCH TREE WASHED HERSELF ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND DRIED HERSELF ON THE OTHER
WHEN THE SUPPER WAS ENDED HE BADE HIS WIFE BRING HIM HIS HEN THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS
THEN THE SECOND SON WENT TO THE FOREST AND HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM A GOOD CAKE AND A BOTTLE OF WINE AS SHE HAD TO HIS ELDER BROTHER
NO SAID HALVOR I WILL NOT GO FOR I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG AND I HAVE NO REASON TO BE AFRAID HE WON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT SAID THE PRINCESS FOR HE WILL TAKE YOU WITHOUT LEAVE OR RIGHT
ON ENTERING THE THRONE-ROOM WHEN THE CROWD SAW THAT THERE WAS ALREADY SOMEONE ON THE ROYAL SEAT THEY BROKE OUT IN CRIES OF SURPRISE AND JOY
HERE THE KING AND QUEEN WERE WAITING AND THEY RECEIVED THE PRINCESS WITH SUCH JOY AND KINDNESS THAT SHE COULD NOT GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE TO SAY HOW SORRY SHE WAS FOR HAVING RUN AWAY WITH SUCH A VERY POOR SPIRITED AMBASSADOR
NOW I HEARD IT QUITE DISTINCTLY AND IT NEIGHED LIKE A FULL-GROWN HORSE ANSWERED THE YOUTH
AT LENGTH WEARIED TO DEATH SHE REACHED THE PALACE IN WHICH THE SUN LIVED
THEY CALLED HER SNOWDROP AND NOT LONG AFTER HER BIRTH THE QUEEN DIED
YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOAN OF MY HORSE AND CARRIAGE AND THEN YOU WILL GET THERE BY NIGHT
HE DID NOT EVEN COME TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER BUT ALL THE SAME SHE KNEW THE DAY AND HOUR OF HIS DEPARTURE AND HID HERSELF ON THE ROAD TO SEE HIM ONCE MORE
BECAUSE IT IS SO OLD AND SO BEAUTIFUL THE STORY IS TOLD HERE AGAIN BUT IT HAS A SAD ENDING--INDEED IT IS ALL SAD AND ALL ABOUT FIGHTING AND KILLING AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE DANES ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
WHY SHOULD NOT RENELDE TRY IT IV RENELDE DID TRY AND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THE NETTLES WHEN CRUSHED AND PREPARED GAVE A GOOD THREAD SOFT AND LIGHT AND FIRM
HE WAS DRESSED IN A GREEN JACKET WITH A LEATHER BELT AND RED BREECHES AND ON HIS FEET WERE SANDALS FASTENED BY THONGS PASSED ROUND HIS LEGS IN THE GIPSY FASHION
THEN AT LAST HIS HEART MELTED
RENELDE TREMBLED
AFTER HAVING THUS ENTERTAINED HER FRIENDS SHE DISTRIBUTED HER DOLLS AMONG THEM AND LEFT HER BROTHER'S KINGDOM TO THE CARE OF THE WISEST OLD MEN OF THE CITY TELLING THEM TO TAKE CHARGE OF EVERYTHING NOT TO SPEND ANY MONEY BUT SAVE IT ALL UP UNTIL THE KING SHOULD RETURN AND ABOVE ALL NOT TO FORGET TO FEED HER PEACOCK
NOW I MUST GO TO THE BOTTOM HE SAID BUT WHEN I GIVE A GOOD JERK TO THE CABLE AND WANT TO COME UP AGAIN YOU MUST ALL PULL LIKE ONE MAN OR THERE WILL BE AN END OF ALL LIFE BOTH FOR YOU AND FOR ME SO SAYING HE SPRANG INTO THE WATER AND YELLOW BUBBLES ROSE UP ALL AROUND HIM
EVERYTHING IN THE KING'S PALACE WAS HUNG WITH BLACK AND EVERYONE WAS SORROWFUL AND DISTRESSED
HE TOOK HIS KNIFE AND CUT IT OPEN
IF YOU SPIT YOU MISERABLE CREATURE IF YOU SPIT INTO THE SHEATH OF MY KNIFE OR IF YOU RUN BETWEEN MY LEGS I SHALL CHANGE YOU INTO A BLACK SHEEP THE WOMAN NEITHER SPAT NOR DID SHE RUN BETWEEN HER LEGS BUT YET THE WITCH CHANGED HER INTO A SHEEP
A GREAT WEDDING BANQUET WAS PREPARED AND AFTER THREE DAYS OF FEASTING THE HAPPY PAIR WERE ACCOMPANIED TO THE FRONTIER WITH MUCH CEREMONY AND REJOICING
HE WEPT AND WEPT--AND THEN RETURNED BACK AGAIN TO MARYA MOREVNA
HAPPILY FOR HER THE LADY WAS NOT TO BE FOUND
IX TALKING IN THIS WAY THEY DREW NEAR TO THE CASTLE
GUILBERT BECAME IMPATIENT
TAKE ME BACK QUICKLY IF YOU LOVE ME AND SO THOUGH HE DID NOT WANT TO AT ALL HE WAS OBLIGED TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD LET HER GO
A TROLL WITH THREE HEADS LIVES HERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL PLEASED IF HE HAD HAD FOUR HEADS MORE FOR I SHOULD HAVE ENJOYED SEEING THE FELLOW SAID THE YOUTH
HE TRAVELLED IN THIS WAY FOR MANY WEEKS PASSING BY VILLAGES TOWNS MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND PLAINS BUT ALWAYS PUSHING SOUTH WHERE EVERY DAY THE SUN SEEMED HOTTER AND MORE BRILLIANT
BUT THE GIRL REMEMBERED HER MOTHER'S WARNING
SISTER OPEN THE DOOR I MUST GET OUT SO SISTER OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID NOW MIND AND GET BACK BY NIGHTFALL AND SAY YOUR LITTLE RHYME AS SOON AS THE KING AND HIS HUNTSMEN SAW THE ROE WITH THE GOLDEN COLLAR THEY ALL RODE OFF AFTER IT BUT IT WAS FAR TOO QUICK AND NIMBLE FOR THEM
THE OLD WITCH THOUGHT HERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE FOR HER
YOU MUST FIND ME SOME TASK FOR THIS FINE PRINCESS WHICH SHE CANNOT POSSIBLY DO FOR I MEAN TO PUNISH HER AND IF SHE DOES NOT DO WHAT I ORDER SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I AM UNJUST SO THE OLD FAIRY SAID SHE WOULD THINK IT OVER AND COME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY
BUT I HAVE A SHIP OF MY OWN SAID MINNIKIN AND HE TOOK THE ONE WHICH THE OLD WOMAN HAD GIVEN HIM OUT OF HIS POCKET
SIRE REPLIED THE COCKCHAFER HIS KINGDOM IS THIRTY THOUSAND LEAGUES FROM THIS
I HAD BETTER HAVE MARRIED MY AMIABLE SHEPHERD
BUT WHEN HE GOT THERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WERE DEAD AND HIS BROTHERS HAD DIVIDED EVERYTHING THAT THEIR PARENTS POSSESSED BETWEEN THEMSELVES SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL LEFT FOR HIM
BUT WHAT A PITY TO DROWN SUCH A PRETTY PRINCESS HOWEVER AT LAST THE NURSE PERSUADED HIM TO HELP HER AND WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THE PRINCESS WAS FAST ASLEEP AS USUAL WITH FRISK CURLED UP ON HIS OWN CUSHION AT THE FOOT OF HER BED THE WICKED NURSE FETCHED THE BOATMAN AND HER DAUGHTER AND BETWEEN THEM THEY PICKED UP THE PRINCESS FEATHER BED MATTRESS PILLOWS BLANKETS AND ALL AND THREW HER INTO THE SEA WITHOUT EVEN WAKING HER
WILT THOU HOLD THYSELF IN READINESS TO TRAVEL AWAY NEXT MONDAY NIGHT
AMONG THE HERD THERE WAS A GREAT BLUE BULL WHICH ALWAYS KEPT ITSELF VERY SMART AND SLEEK AND OFTEN CAME TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER AND LET HER STROKE HIM
WHEN THE TIME COMES I SHALL BE AT HAND NOW AFTER SOME TIME IT HAPPENED ONE DAY WHEN THE KING WAS OUT HUNTING THAT THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY
YOU SHALL GO AND RETURN IN PERFECT SAFETY IF YOU WILL FOLLOW OUR ADVICE SAID THE PRINCESSES
HOWEVER WE WILL TRY
WHEN THEIR FATHER AND MOTHER LAY AT THE POINT OF DEATH THEY HAD THUS ENJOINED THEIR SON
SHE SOILS EVERYTHING WITH CINDERS
HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU A MORTAL TO GET HITHER TO THE HOUSE OF THE MOON THEN THE POOR PRINCESS TOLD HER ALL THAT HAPPENED TO HER AND ADDED I SHALL ALWAYS BE THANKFUL TO HEAVEN FOR LEADING ME HITHER AND GRATEFUL TO YOU THAT YOU TOOK PITY ON ME AND ON MY BABY AND DID NOT LEAVE US TO DIE
WHEN LINA DISCOVERED IT SHE WAS MUCH SURPRISED
THEN THE KING CRIED MURDER AND THIEVES AND ALL HIS GUARDS RAN TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT THEY COULD FIND NOTHING AND NOBODY FOR THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD RUN OFF TO THE PRINCE'S ROOM AND WAS SERVING HIM IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
GO AND FIND OUT THE BEST COOKING-POT IN THE TOWN AND BRING THE CONTENTS TO ME AWAY WENT FRISK AND AS THERE WAS NO BETTER DINNER COOKING IN ALL THE TOWN THAN THE KING'S HE ADROITLY TOOK THE COVER OFF THE POT AND BROUGHT ALL IT CONTAINED TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAID
HOWEVER HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LET THIS BIRD FLY AWAY
NOW THERE WAS A LITTLE GARDEN ROUND THE ENCHANTED HOUSE IN WHICH GREW TWELVE TALL LILIES
SHE WAS AS JEALOUS AS SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE BECAUSE THE GIRL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND CHARMING WHILE HER OWN DAUGHTER WAS BOTH UGLY AND REPULSIVE
BUT WHEN HE HEARD DRAKESTAIL SINGING AGAIN AND WHEN THEY TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED HE BECAME FURIOUS AND GOT UP FROM TABLE BRANDISHING HIS FISTS
I TOOK UP THE BUNDLE THAT CONTAINED EVERYTHING BELONGING TO THE CORPSE THAT WAS VALUABLE INTENDING TO TAKE MY DEPARTURE FROM THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE
SIRE SAID THE PRINCE MY BROTHER IS A KING LIKE YOURSELF
WHEN SHE GOT THERE WITH HER PAILS THE FIRST HEAD ROSE UP OUT OF THE WATER CLOSE TO THE BANK
AT LAST WEARY AND TERRIFIED SHE SAT DOWN AND CRIED
THEN SHE'LL WAIT FOR YOU THEREUPON THE WOLF CUTS ACROSS THE WOOD AND IN FIVE MINUTES ARRIVES AT THE GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE
BUT WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE CARCASSES OF THE OXEN THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT FOR THEM TILL THE BLOOD FLOWED AND THEY ENTIRELY FORGOT DAPPLEGRIM AND THE YOUTH
NOW YOU MUST GO UP TO THE KING AND ASK FOR NEW SHOES FOR ME AND FOR THEM WE MUST AGAIN HAVE TEN POUNDS OF IRON TWELVE POUNDS OF STEEL AND TWO SMITHS ONE TO HAMMER AND ONE TO HOLD BUT BE VERY PARTICULAR TO SEE THAT THE HOOKS ARE VERY SHARP
FROM COMBLAND SAID KARI
IT IS ONLY A NICE FRESH STEAK OFF AN ELEPHANT THAT I HAVE COOKED FOR YOU WHICH YOU SMELL
THE YOUNG MAN LAY DOWN IN A BED WHICH STOOD NEAR BUT HE DARED NOT GO TO SLEEP
SO THEY ALL SET OUT TOGETHER AND THE MAN'S DAUGHTER TOOK WITH HER A CASKET IN WHICH SHE KEPT HER GOLD AND A DOG WHICH WAS CALLED LITTLE SNOW
I WISH TO HEAVEN THEY WERE HERE AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE THEM SCARCELY HAD HE SAID THIS BEFORE THEY WERE STANDING BY HIS SIDE BUT THEN HE WAS VERY SORROWFUL FOR THE WORDS WHICH THEY HAD SAID TO HIM CAME TO HIS MIND
IF SHE CHASED THEM IN THE MEADOW THEY FLED INTO THE WOOD AND IF SHE PURSUED THEM INTO THE WOOD THEY DODGED ROUND TREES AND BEHIND SPRIGS OF MOSS AND WITH PEALS OF ELFIN LAUGHTER SCAMPERED BACK AGAIN INTO THE MEADOW
I WILL GIVE THE OTHER ONE WORK LEST SHE WEARY SHE KINDLED THE FIRE THREW A POTFUL OF HEMP SEED AMONG THE ASHES AND SAID TO THE GIRL
HE SUFFERED HORRIBLY AND CALLED LOUDLY ON DEATH TO PUT AN END TO HIS PAINS
SOON SHE CAME TO THE APPLE TREE WHICH CRIED
FLY FROM THE TOWER PRINCE AND REMEMBER THAT THE FAIRY DOUCELINE WILL BE YOUR FRIEND ALWAYS WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRINCE TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT FOUND HIMSELF NO LONGER IN THE TOWER BUT SET DOWN IN A THICK FOREST AT LEAST A HUNDRED LEAGUES AWAY FROM IT
BUT THE BUYER HAD NOT GOT FAR ON HIS WAY BEFORE THE YOUTH TOOK HIS OWN FORM AGAIN AND WHEN THE MAN REACHED HOME JACK WAS ALREADY SITTING ON THE BENCH BY THE STOVE
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF A BALL AND THE PRINCE COULD WATCH THE LITTLE DANCING PEOPLE COME AND GO
THIS CASTLE WAS ONCE YOUR FATHER'S AND MUST AGAIN BE YOURS JACK UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE
THEY TOOK IT TO THE COURT AND TRIED TO PACIFY IT IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY BUT ITS CRYING NEVER CEASED
BUT IF ANYBODY WHO WENT TO SEE HER HAPPENED TO MENTION THE CHARMING PRINCESS SHE WOULD CRY ANGRILY
HE ONLY ANSWERED
NOW ALL THE REQUEST I ASK OF YOU IS THAT YOU WILL BUILD A TOWER IN AN ISLAND IN THE SEA WHEREIN YOU WILL KEEP YOUR THREE SONS UNTIL THEY ARE COME OF AGE AND FIT TO DO FOR THEMSELVES
AT THE SIGHT OF HIM THE PRINCESS LOST HER WITS ENTIRELY AND DETERMINED THAT FANFARONADE AND NOBODY ELSE WOULD SHE MARRY
THE FAIRY WHO WATCHES OVER YOUR DESTINY TOLD ME THIS AND IT WAS SHE WHO GUIDED YOU TO THE CABINET IN THE TURRET WHERE SHE HAD PLACED MY HAND
BUT AS SOON AS HE CAME THE KING TOOK HIM BY THE NECK AND FLUNG HIM OUT AND THEN THE NORTH WIND LAID HOLD OF HIM AND CARRIED HIM OFF
WHERE IS HE GONE
GIVE THEM TO MY DAUGHTER RATHER WELL THEN THE PRINCE GAVE THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER THE RING AND THE WOMAN FILED AND PARED AWAY AT HER DAUGHTER'S FINGER TILL THE RING FITTED
ARISE PRINCE
COME LET US BE QUICK FOR FEAR THE WATER SHOULD GET COLD HER DAUGHTER WAS AT HAND TOO AND BETWEEN THEM THEY CARRIED THE QUEEN WHO WAS STILL VERY WEAK INTO THE BATH-ROOM AND LAID HER IN THE BATH
SOON AFTERWARDS THE TROLL CAME AND HE WAS SO LARGE AND STOUT THAT HE WAS FORCED TO GO SIDEWAYS TO GET THROUGH THE DOOR
THE PRINCESS WAS NOW EXCEEDINGLY DELIGHTED BUT THEN SHE REMEMBERED HER SISTERS AND WISHED THAT THEY TOO WERE FREE
THIS TIME THE COUNT RESOLVED TO GO TO LOCQUIGNOL HIMSELF
TO-MORROW ALL WILL BE READY AND THE TAILOR FOLLOWED HIS LAD'S ADVICE AND WENT TO BED
ALL THE NAMES IN THE CALENDAR ARE TAKEN ALREADY THE MOTHER SAT DOWN ON THE STAIRCASE BESIDE HER DAUGHTER AND SAID I WILL THINK ABOUT IT WITH YOU MY DEAR THE FATHER WHO HAD STAYED UPSTAIRS WITH THE YOUNG MAN WAS SURPRISED THAT NEITHER HIS WIFE NOR HIS DAUGHTER CAME BACK AND IN HIS TURN WENT DOWN TO LOOK FOR THEM
WHILE GRACIOSA WAS WAITING UNTIL THE KING SHOULD BE READY TO SET OUT SHE WENT DOWN ALL ALONE THROUGH THE GARDEN INTO A LITTLE WOOD WHERE SHE SAT DOWN UPON A MOSSY BANK AND BEGAN TO THINK
BUT THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER GNAWED BONES UNDER THE TABLE AND THE PRINCE GAVE HER A PUSH BY MISTAKE WHICH BROKE HER LEG--HE HAD NEVER NOTICED HER CRAWLING ABOUT AMONG THE PEOPLE'S FEET
MY LADY QUEEN YOU ARE FAIR TIS TRUE BUT SNOWDROP IS FAIRER FAR THAN YOU THEN THE QUEEN FLEW INTO THE MOST AWFUL PASSION AND TURNED EVERY SHADE OF GREEN IN HER JEALOUSY
AS SHE GREW OLDER THE LITTLE GYPSY BECAME MUCH MORE REMARKABLE FOR STRENGTH AND CUNNING THAN FOR SENSE OR BEAUTY
THE TRAVELLER HAVING RECOVERED MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND AT THE FIRST STREAK OF DAWN HE SAW A STREAM DANCING IN FRONT OF HIM AND STOOPED DOWN AND DRANK HIS FILL
OH FAIRY DOUCELINE HAVE YOU ABANDONED ME AFTER SO MANY PROMISES OF FRIENDSHIP
DON'T DISTURB MY HONEY PRINCE IVAN EXCLAIMS THE QUEEN-BEE
HE PUT THIS IN THE ROAD BY WHICH THE MAN MUST GO WITH HIS OX AND THEN WENT INTO THE WOOD AND HID HIMSELF UNDER A BUSH
IS THIS THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY YES FATHER IT IS SHE REPLIED DESIRE WITH A SHEEPISH LOOK
REMEMBER ALL THE GIANT POSSESSES IS REALLY YOURS AS SHE CEASED SPEAKING THE LADY OF THE RED HAT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND OF COURSE JACK KNEW SHE WAS A FAIRY
OH IT'S ONLY A LITTLE DROP OF BRANDY YOUR HONOUR SHE SAID
DO GIVE IT TO ME SAID THE PRINCESS AND I WILL KEEP IT AND TAKE CARE OF IT I CAN HARDLY DO THAT SAID HE FOR TO SPEAK MORE PLAINLY I MEAN THAT I MET THE DUCHESS GRUMBLY AND HAVE PROMISED TO MARRY HER AND YOU CALL HER A DOVE CRIED THE PRINCESS
AND THE VERY BIRDS OF THE AIR CAME AND BEWAILED SNOWDROP'S DEATH FIRST AN OWL AND THEN A RAVEN AND LAST OF ALL A LITTLE DOVE
SHE WASHED OFF THE BLOOD BOUND UP THE INJURED FOOT WITH HERBS AND SAID
ALLOW ME MY FATHER TO GO AND GIVE ALMS TO THE BEGGARS HE GAVE HER LEAVE AND SHE WENT AND BEGAN BESTOWING ALMS UPON THEM AND EXAMINING THEM CLOSELY
THE ROOM WAS QUITE EMPTY AND WITHOUT ANY ORNAMENT BUT IN THE MIDDLE STOOD A LARGE TABLE WITH A GORGEOUS CLOTH AND ON IT LAY A BIG OPEN BOOK
IN A MOMENT THEY TOUCHED LAND AND THE COMPANY JUMPED OUT OF THE BOATS
THE WILD BEASTS WILL SOON EAT HER UP AND HIS HEART FELT LIGHTER BECAUSE HE HADN'T HAD TO DO THE DEED HIMSELF
BUT ALL THE SAME AS HE ADORED HIS SON HE GAVE THE GYPSY HIS HAND AND LED HER TO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE BRIDAL FEAST WAS SPREAD
BUT THE DAPPLED COLT WAS SO BIG THAT WHEN THE LAD WANTED TO FEEL ITS NECK TO SEE HOW FAT IT WAS HE COULD NOT REACH UP TO IT IT WAS SO HIGH
SHE THEN MADE READY THE PIE AND AFTER EATING AND DRINKING HEARTILY MYSELF I WAS JUST TAKING MY LEAVE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN WE OBSERVED THE GIANT COMING THROUGH THE CASTLE GATES
AND THE INHABITANTS OF HAMEL BEGAN TO GO TO THE DOGS NOT THAT THEY WERE OF MUCH USE WHEN ONE FRIDAY THERE ARRIVED IN THE TOWN A MAN WITH A QUEER FACE WHO PLAYED THE BAGPIPES AND SANG THIS REFRAIN
YOU ARE GOING TO SEND THE CHILD AWAY TO THE WOOD SAID THE WITCH IN A SUSPICIOUS TONE AND TRIED TO INTERFERE
THEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER SAID
WHEREFORE HAVE YOU COME
BUT THE FAIRIES SAID THEY HAD LEFT THEIR BOOK OF MAGIC AT HOME AND THEY WOULD COME ANOTHER DAY AND TELL HER
JACK STOPPED TO LOOK AT THEM AND THE BUTCHER TOLD THE BOY THAT THEY WERE OF GREAT VALUE AND PERSUADED THE SILLY LAD TO SELL THE COW FOR THESE BEANS
BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AT THEM HE FOUND THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN IN A FORGOTTEN LANGUAGE AND HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND A SINGLE WORD THOUGH HE AMUSED HIMSELF WITH TRYING
SO MINNIKIN CALLED FOR THE THIRD TIME AND WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND THERE STOOD HIS BROTHER BY HIS SIDE
SPIT YOU WRETCH ON THE BLADE OF MY KNIFE
THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS LONG AGO PROMISED AWAY TO THREE TROLLS AND NEXT THURSDAY EVENING ONE OF THEM IS TO COME TO FETCH HER
IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LORDS AND KNIGHTS OF THE KINGDOM COUNSELLED THE KING AS HE WAS YOUNG TO LIVE NO LONGER AS HE HAD DONE BUT TO TAKE A WIFE
LET ME HAVE TWO OR THREE DAYS TO MAKE UP MY MIND AND THEN YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE WITH ME THE WICKED PRINCE WOULD HAVE LIKED VERY MUCH TO SEE HER TARRED AND FEATHERED BUT THE KING ORDERED THAT SHE SHOULD BE SHUT UP IN A DARK DUNGEON
IT WAS WHISPERED ABOUT THAT THEY LED EXACTLY THE LIVES THAT PRINCESSES OUGHT TO LEAD SLEEPING FAR INTO THE MORNING AND NEVER GETTING UP TILL MID-DAY
THIS HE TOOK AND FILLED IT WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND THEN HE TIED THE CABLE ROUND HIMSELF AND THE PRINCESS AND THE CHEST AND TUGGED AT THE ROPE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT WHEREUPON HIS MEN DREW THEM UP SAFE AND SOUND
AND IF YOU GIVE SATISFACTION AND KEEP EVERYTHING NEAT AND CLEAN YOU SHALL WANT FOR NOTHING YES ANSWERED SNOWDROP I WILL GLADLY DO ALL YOU ASK AND SO SHE TOOK UP HER ABODE WITH THEM
AT LAST THE ELDEST SAID BE QUICK MY SISTERS OUR PARTNERS WILL BE IMPATIENT AT THE END OF AN HOUR WHEN THE STAR GAZER HEARD NO MORE NOISE HE PEEPED OUT AND SAW THE TWELVE SISTERS IN SPLENDID GARMENTS WITH THEIR SATIN SHOES ON THEIR FEET AND IN THEIR HANDS THE BOUQUETS HE HAD BROUGHT THEM
AH SHE CRIED THIS IS ALTOGETHER BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION SIRE
SO YOU WON'T MARRY ME SAID HE
NO I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO THAT THEREUPON THE FAIRY IN A RAGE GAVE TWO STROKES OF HER WAND AND FILLED THE GALLERY WITH HORRIBLE GOBLINS AGAINST WHOM THE PRINCE HAD TO FIGHT FOR HIS LIFE
WHEN THE MOTHER CAME AND SAW HER YOU MAY IMAGINE WHAT A STATE OF MIND SHE WAS IN AND HOW SHE SCREAMED AND LAMENTED BUT NEITHER THE NOSE NOR THE JAW GREW ANY THE LESS FOR THAT
AND WHERE MAY YOU BE GOING SAID THE NORTH WIND
BUT JUST THROW OUT THE TWELVE CARCASSES OF THE OXEN AND THEY WILL BE SO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEM THAT THEY WILL QUITE FORGET US SO THE YOUTH THREW OUT THE CARCASSES OF THE OXEN AND THEN ALL THE WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST BOTH BEARS AND WOLVES AND LIONS AND GRIM BEASTS OF ALL KINDS CAME
ALL THAT THEY COULD SEE WAS A VAST PLAIN THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THERE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD
SO THE POOR GIRL FOUND HERSELF LEFT ALL ALONE IN THE WOOD AND AS SHE LOOKED ROUND HER SHE NOTICED AN OLD WOMAN STANDING CLOSE BESIDE HER WHO SAID
THEIR FATHER SCOLDED THEM BOTH SOUNDLY AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT
FOR THREE NIGHTS LINA NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY
IN THIS MISERABLE PLIGHT GRACIOSA DID INDEED REGRET THE FAIRY PALACE AND SHE WOULD HAVE CALLED PERCINET TO HER AID ONLY SHE FELT SURE HE WAS STILL VEXED WITH HER FOR LEAVING HIM AND THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD NOT EXPECT HIM TO COME
WE ARE NOT ILL MET THEN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS DRIVING FOR I AM THE KIND OF MAN WHO CAN DO THAT AND I AM JUST LOOKING OUT FOR SUCH AN APPRENTICE
BUT FIRST OF ALL HE MUST HAVE NEW SHOES AND TEN POUNDS OF IRON AND TWELVE POUNDS OF STEEL MUST GO TO THE MAKING OF THEM AND TWO SMITHS WERE ALSO NECESSARY ONE TO HAMMER AND ONE TO HOLD AND THEN IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO MAKE THE SUN SHINE INTO THE KING'S PALACE
WELL IF SHE IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THAT I WILL HAVE HER FOR MY QUEEN SAID THE KING AND HE COMMANDED THE YOUTH TO GO HOME AND FETCH HER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY AND TO LOSE NO TIME IN COMING BACK
TAKE THIS BOOT WHICH HAS A HOLE IN THE SOLE HANG IT UP ON A NAIL IN THE HAYLOFT AND POUR WATER INTO IT
SO SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO THE DUCHESS GRUMBLY'S ROOM
WHAT A HARD LOT YOURS MUST HAVE BEEN TO MAKE YOU HANG YOURSELF SAID HE
FAIR ONE I KNOW NOT BY WHAT ENCHANTMENT THOU ART BOUND BUT IN THE NAME OF THY BELOVED FLORIMOND I CONJURE THEE TO COME BACK TO THE LIFE WHICH THOU HAST LOST BUT NOT FORGOTTEN INSTANTLY THE LADY OPENED HER LUSTROUS EYES AND SAW THE EAGLE HOVERING NEAR
THEN HE BECAME SO DIVERTED AT THE NOTION OF HIS SON MARRYING A YELLOW WOMAN AND A WOMAN SHUT UP INSIDE AN ORANGE THAT HE BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER
AT LAST THE THIRD SISTER CAME WITH THE SAME INTENTIONS BUT THE OTHER TWO CRIED OUT
TOC TOC
I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU HAVE SUCH A PRETTY QUEEN AS I HAVE WOULD TO HEAVEN SHE WERE STANDING HERE AND THEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE SAID THE YOUNG KING AND IN AN INSTANT SHE WAS STANDING THERE
THEY HAVE CARVED ON THE ROCKS PICTURES OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE TALE AND THOSE CARVINGS MAY STILL BE SEEN
THEN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BELOW SAY IT SNOWS FOR I AM MOTHER HOLLE SHE SPOKE SO KINDLY THAT THE GIRL TOOK HEART AND AGREED READILY TO ENTER HER SERVICE
SO THEY TRAVELLED FOR A LONG TIME AND THROUGH MANY LANDS AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER DID NOT AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WAS TAKING HER BUT AFTER A LONG LONG TIME THEY CAME TO A GOLD WOOD
I SEE NOTHING TO EAT AND THOUGH YOU MAY BE VERY CHARMING THE SIGHT OF YOU DOES NOT PREVENT ME FROM FAMISHING WHAT
SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP DOING SO AND THEN YOU WILL BE QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT SO THE QUEEN CAME TO GRACIOSA AND SAID
ONLY DO NOT VENTURE TO LOOK INTO THAT CLOSET THERE HE COULDN'T HELP DOING SO
THE KING WILL THEN DO SO AND THERE WILL BE A GREAT FEAST PREPARED ON THAT ACCOUNT AND ALSO DIVERSIONS OF EVERY SORT TO AMUSE THE PEOPLE
IT WAS OF GREEN AND GOLD BROCADE EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND RUBIES AND HER LONG GOLDEN HAIR WAS TIED BACK WITH STRINGS OF DIAMONDS AND EMERALDS AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS
EVERY TIME THAT SHE HEARD OF ANOTHER MISDEED OF HER HUSBAND'S SHE SECRETLY WENT TO REPAIR THE EVIL WHICH CAUSED HER NAME TO BE BLESSED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY-SIDE
THEY WATCHED ALL NIGHT BEHIND THE OPEN DOOR OF THE PRINCESSES BUT WHEN THE MORNING CAME THEY HAD ALL DISAPPEARED AND NO ONE COULD TELL WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM
BUT THE GOVERNOR GAVE HIM A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND SAID THAT HE MUST DO SOMETHING THAT WAS BETTER STILL
DOWN CAME THE GIANT WITH A TERRIBLE CRASH AND AS HE FELL ON HIS HEAD HE BROKE HIS NECK AND LAY DEAD AT THE FEET OF THE WOMAN HE HAD SO MUCH INJURED
WHEN THE LITTLE DWARFS CAME HOME IN THE EVENING THEY FOUND SNOWDROP LYING ON THE GROUND AND SHE NEITHER BREATHED NOR STIRRED
BUT PRINCE IVAN WEPT FULL SORE AND HE ARRAYED HIMSELF AND SET OUT A-WANDERING SAYING TO HIMSELF WHATEVER HAPPENS I WILL GO AND LOOK FOR MARYA MOREVNA ONE DAY PASSED ANOTHER DAY PASSED
BUT WHEN HE WAS QUITE HIGH UP THE FAIRY WHO HAD MADE HERSELF INVISIBLE AND FOLLOWED THEM GAVE HIM A SUDDEN PUSH WHICH MADE HIM LOSE HIS FOOTING AND FALL TO THE GROUND WITH A CRASH AND BREAK FOUR OF HIS TEETH AND WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO MEND THEM THE FAIRY CARRIED THE QUEEN OFF IN HER FLYING CHARIOT TO A BEAUTIFUL CASTLE WHERE SHE WAS SO KIND TO HER THAT BUT FOR THE LOSS OF DELICIA THE QUEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY
SHE HAD CREPT SECRETLY AFTER THEM AND HAD CAST HER SPELLS OVER ALL THE STREAMS IN THE FOREST
RENELDE OBEYED AND THAT EVENING GUILBERT ASKED HER
IF ANYONE SHOULD COME WHO WANTS TO BUY ME SAID HE YOU ARE TO TELL HIM THAT YOU WANT A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ME
I DREAMED THAT IN THE LAND OF THE SUN THERE WAS A WOOD FULL OF ORANGE TREES AND THAT IN ONE OF THE ORANGES I SHOULD FIND A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WHO IS TO BE MY WIFE
FOR YOUR GREATER PUNISHMENT I WILL NOT BOIL YOU ALL TOGETHER BUT ONE AFTER THE OTHER SO THAT HE THAT SURVIVES MAY WITNESS THE DIRE AFFLICTIONS OF HIS UNFORTUNATE COMPANIONS SO SAYING HE ORDERED HIS SERVANTS TO STIR UP THE FIRE
IT'S A REMARKABLY FINE HARE SAID THE GOVERNOR
FROM WHENCE DO YOU COME THEN INQUIRED THE KING FOR BY THIS TIME HE WANTED TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE MEN BEFORE HE TOOK ANY OF THEM INTO HIS SERVICE
AT LENGTH IT BEGAN TO BEND AND I FOUND THAT ONE OR TWO BLOWS AT THE MOST WOULD PUT IT DOWN
I ONLY LOOK AFTER THE GOVERNOR'S GEESE THAT'S WHAT I DO AND THEY ARE THE LITTLE FIENDS WHICH HAVE PINCHED YOUR REVERENCE THIS IS THE MASTER THIEF'S DOING
ON HEARING THE PROCLAMATION A NUMBER OF PRINCES ARRIVED AT THE CASTLE TO TRY THEIR LUCK
IF I WERE BUT AT HOME AGAIN OR IF HOME WERE BUT HERE SAID HALVOR AND NO SOONER HAD HE WISHED THIS THAN IT WAS GRANTED
YOU KNOW THE WAY THEN SAID THE OTHER
WHEN ROSETTE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THE GREAT PRINCE WENT TO THE KING AND ASKED IF IT WOULD NOT SOON BE TIME FOR HER TO BE MARRIED AND THE LITTLE PRINCE PUT THE SAME QUESTION TO THE QUEEN
THE RAVEN SMOTE UPON THE FLOOR AND BECAME A BRAVE YOUTH
ALL YOUR RATS TOOK A JUMP INTO THE RIVER YESTERDAY SAID HE TO THE COUNSELLORS AND I GUARANTEE THAT NOT ONE OF THEM COMES BACK
PERHAPS HE'LL BE KILLED
DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE THE CORD OF THE BUCKET AND SPREAD IT IN THE SUN
OF A SUDDEN HE HEARD A VOICE WHICH SEEMED STRANGELY FAMILIAR TO HIM
SHE WAS VERY UNLUCKY
WAIT A MINUTE REPLIED DESIRE SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT HE FORGOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS
BUT THE YOUTH WENT DOWN INTO THE STABLE AND ASKED DAPPLEGRIM WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH HERSELF
ALL HAD BEEN SPENT
SHE PONDERED DAY AND NIGHT HOW SHE MIGHT DESTROY HER FOR AS LONG AS SHE FELT SHE HAD A RIVAL IN THE LAND HER JEALOUS HEART LEFT HER NO REST
SIGURD WENT OUT AND BRYNHILD DETERMINED TO SLAY HIM
SHAKE ME SHAKE ME MY APPLES ARE ALL QUITE RIPE I'LL SEE MYSELF FARTHER SHE REPLIED ONE OF THEM MIGHT FALL ON MY HEAD AND SO SHE PURSUED HER WAY
THEY HAD TWELVE BEDS ALL IN THE SAME ROOM BUT WHAT WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY WAS THE FACT THAT THOUGH THEY WERE LOCKED IN BY TRIPLE BOLTS EVERY MORNING THEIR SATIN SHOES WERE FOUND WORN INTO HOLES
AFTER A LONG LONG TIME THEY CAME TO A HIGH HILL WHERE THERE WAS A PRECIPITOUS WALL OF ROCK
TO HER SURPRISE THEY STUCK TIGHT
THIS IS A BAD BUSINESS FOR US GOSSIP
AS YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY GUESS HOW MUCH I LIKE YOU SIR FANFARONADE I AM OBLIGED TO TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT SINCE I SAW YOU ENTER THE TOWN ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL PRANCING HORSE I HAVE BEEN SORRY THAT YOU CAME TO SPEAK FOR ANOTHER INSTEAD OF FOR YOURSELF
IF OUR OWN DEAR MOTHER ONLY KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
HE HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO DO THIS HE SAID
WHEN HE ASKED THE PIKE IT SAID YES WHITELAND IS WELL KNOWN TO ME FOR I HAVE BEEN COOK THERE THESE TEN YEARS
I DECLARE THAT I WILL NEVER MARRY ANY ONE BUT THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS AND WHEN I AM QUEEN I WILL TAKE VERY GOOD CARE THAT NOBODY EATS ANY OF MY SUBJECTS AT THIS THE KING WAS VERY MUCH ASTONISHED
ARE YOU NOT SORRY FOR THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER
THEN HE BROUGHT OUT ALL THE HORSES THE ROBBERS HAD AND LOADED THEM WITH THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS WHICH HE COULD FIND--VESSELS OF GOLD AND OF SILVER AND CLOTHES AND OTHER MAGNIFICENT THINGS--AND THEN HE TOLD THE OLD WOMAN TO GREET THE ROBBERS FROM HIM AND THANK THEM FROM HIM AND SAY THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HIM AGAIN AND WITH THAT HE DROVE THE HORSES OUT OF THE COURTYARD
DON'T DRINK SUDDENLY CRIED OUT THE LITTLE PRINCESS
SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE WAS CALLED THE PRINCESS ZIZI
THE BATTLE IS LOST AND THE KING IS DEAD AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE ENEMY WILL BE HERE THE POOR QUEEN FELL BACK INSENSIBLE AND ALL HER LADIES CARRIED HER TO BED AND STOOD ROUND HER WEEPING AND WAILING
THERE HUNG SUCH ROBES AS HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE ALL SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES
AGAIN THE PRINCE GAVE THE BEAST THREE WOUNDS AND THEN HE AND THE BEAST LAY DOWN AGAIN TO REST
DOST THOU THINK THAT THOU ART FIT TO GO WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE THEE SAID THE SKIPPER
FOR THREE DAYS NOTHING HAPPENED BUT AT LAST IN THE NIGHT THE PRINCESS HEARD SOMETHING FLUTTER AGAINST HER WINDOW AND DRAWING BACK HER CURTAINS SHE SAW IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT IT WAS AN EAGLE
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME THIS IS THE WAY TO HEAVEN
WHEN THEY GOT TO THE TRUNK THE ELDEST FOAL BROKE IT DOWN ON ONE SIDE AND THEN THEY SAW A DOOR WHERE THE TRUNK HAD BEEN STANDING AND INSIDE THIS THERE WAS A SMALL ROOM AND IN THE ROOM THERE WAS SCARCELY ANYTHING BUT A SMALL FIRE-PLACE AND A COUPLE OF BENCHES BUT BEHIND THE DOOR HUNG A GREAT RUSTY SWORD AND A SMALL PITCHER
SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO SET OUT IN SEARCH OF A LAND WHERE THERE WAS NO DEATH
YOU POOR THING THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU TO SEE HERE AND WE--AH
AND NOW SHE SHOOK NO MORE BUT GUIDED THE FLASK SO THAT EACH OF THEM GOT JUST AS MUCH AS HE OUGHT AND THE TWELFTH HAD NOT DONE DRINKING BEFORE THE FIRST WAS ALREADY SITTING SNORING
HE STRIKES WITH THE KNOCKER
BRING ME THE CHILD TO-MORROW AND AGAIN THE FOLLOWING DAY
I DO NOT WANT ANY REWARD
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD THEY MET THE PARSON AND WHEN HE SAW THIS PROCESSION HE CRIED
AND THERE TOO SIGURD FOUND THE HELM OF DREAD A GOLDEN HELMET AND WHOEVER WEARS IT IS INVISIBLE
THEY WERE ALL VERY HANDSOME AND VERY EXPERT IN ALL ARTS AND EXERCISES SO THAT THEY GAINED THE LOVE AND ESTEEM OF ALL THAT HAD SEEN THEM
OUR CHILDREN
BIG AND HANDSOME YOU WERE LAST YEAR MY COLT BUT THIS YEAR YOU ARE EVER SO MUCH HANDSOMER SAID THE YOUTH
HOW WAS SHE TO GET IN
OH DEAR YES
NOW YOU ARE NO LONGER THE FAIREST SAID THE WICKED OLD WOMAN AND THEN SHE HASTENED AWAY
THE STORY BEGINS SOMETHING LIKE THE TALE
ONLY WAIT A LITTLE AND I BELIEVE I SHALL LOVE YOU QUITE DEARLY PERCINET WAS PLEASED AT THIS AND WITH ONE STROKE OF HIS WAND COMPELLED ALL THE WILFUL LITTLE PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE BOX AND THEN RENDERING THE PRINCESS INVISIBLE HE TOOK HER WITH HIM IN HIS CHARIOT TO THE CASTLE
I MEAN TO MAKE SHORT WORK WITH YOU AND THE SWORD IS BEING SHARPENED THAT WILL CUT OFF YOUR HEADS KING OF THE PEACOCKS ANSWERED THE KING ANGRILY YOU HAD BETTER TAKE CARE WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT
THE THIRD HAD ARRIVED IN TIME BUT IN HARRYING TO GO IN WITH THE OTHERS HAD STRUCK SO VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE WALL OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT HE FELL BACKWARDS AT THE MOMENT IT CLOSED UPON HIS COMRADES
WHEN YOU COME SAILING IN SUCH A SHIP SAID HE YOU SHALL HAVE MY DAUGHTER WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AGAIN DULLHEAD STARTED OFF TO THE FOREST AND THERE HE FOUND THE LITTLE OLD GREY MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD SHARED HIS CAKE AND WHO SAID
I WOULD THAT WE WERE AT SORIA MORIA CASTLE WHEN HALVOR AWOKE HE KNEW THAT HE HAD LOST THE PRINCESSES AND BEGAN TO WEEP AND LAMENT AND WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HE COULD NOT BE COMFORTED
WHEN HE HAD WALKED ON FOR A LONG TIME HE MET FOR THE THIRD TIME AN OLD OLD CROOK-BACKED HAG WHO HAD ONLY ONE EYE
NOW THE KING HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO HAVE ALL THE FLOUR IN HIS KINGDOM BROUGHT TOGETHER AND TO HAVE A HUGE MOUNTAIN BAKED OF IT
BUT THE YOUNGEST WHO IS MY SWEETHEART IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EITHER SUN OR MOON
THE THIRD SON AND SHE THEN PLAYED THE LAST GAME AND HE WON IT WHICH SORELY GRIEVED HER THAT SHE HAD NOT HIM IN HER POWER AS WELL AS THE REST BEING BY FAR THE HANDSOMEST AND MOST BELOVED OF THE THREE
THIS IS LIKE BEING BURIED ALIVE SHE SAID WITH A SHUDDER
THE STALKS HAD TWINED AND TWISTED THEMSELVES TOGETHER TILL THEY FORMED QUITE A LADDER
POOR PRINCESS
THEY JUST HAD TO RUN AFTER HIM RIGHT OR LEFT AS BEST THEY COULD
YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT THEY DID NOT GO THE SHORTEST WAY BUT THE PRINCESS DID NOT FIND IT TOO LONG AND BEFORE THEY PARTED SHE HAD PROMISED THAT IF THE QUEEN WAS STILL CRUEL TO HER AND TRIED AGAIN TO PLAY HER ANY SPITEFUL TRICK SHE WOULD LEAVE HER AND COME TO PERCINET FOR EVER
THEN SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE BEGAN TO DANCE AND THE MAN GOT LEAVE TO STAY ALL NIGHT
TO-MORROW IF YOU LIKE BUT I MAKE ONE CONDITION SAID THE DUCHESS
I OUGHT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR NAME IS AND WHERE YOU LIVE OH I AM AT HOME BOTH IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND THE EAST AND THE WEST AND I AM CALLED FARMER WEATHERBEARD SAID THE MASTER
BUT THE TWO MEN WHO WERE HOLDING THE KING BY THE ARMS SEIZED HIS HANDS AND FORCED A KNIFE INTO HIS GRASP AND THEN MADE HIM CUT HER LITTLE FINGER JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT BLEED
NEVERTHELESS THE NEARER HE CAME TO THE CASTLE THE MORE AFRAID HE WAS
THEN SHE SET OUT ONLY TAKING WITH HER HER NURSE AND THE NURSE'S DAUGHTER AND THE LITTLE GREEN DOG FRISK
MAKE HASTE AND KILL ALL THESE INSOLENT PEACOCKS WHO HAVE DARED TO INSULT ME BUT THE PEACOCKS ONLY FLEW AWAY LAUGHING AT HER
IF SHE IS DEAF AND CAN'T SPEAK SHE MIGHT AT LEAST LAUGH
FOR THOSE WHO ARE ONLY FRIENDLY WITH ME FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE I DO NOT COUNT AT ALL
HAVE YOU COURAGE TO UNDERTAKE IT I FEAR NOTHING WHEN I AM DOING RIGHT SAID JACK
THEY ARRANGED THAT SHE SHOULD STAY AT HOME WITH BENJAMIN AND HELP HIM IN THE HOUSE WORK WHILE THE REST OF THE BROTHERS WENT OUT INTO THE WOOD AND SHOT HARES AND ROE-DEER BIRDS AND WOOD-PIGEONS
SO THE YOUTH SET OUT AND WENT TO THE WOOD AND WHEN THE MAN WAS COMING ALONG WITH THE OX HE BEGAN TO BELLOW LOUDLY JUST LIKE A GREAT OX SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE WOOD
WHEN THEY HAD GONE A BI OF THE WAY THEY CAME TO A PATH WITH HIGH TREES ON EACH SIDE
IMMEDIATELY WORD WAS BROUGHT TO THE WITCH THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD BORNE A SON--FOR THEY ALL BELIEVED THE YOUNG KING'S WIFE TO BE THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER
THE PRINCESS WAS LOOKING AT THE POOR CREATURES IN DISMAY WHEN THE ENCHANTER SUDDENLY ENTERED WEARING A LONG BLACK ROBE AND WITH A CROCODILE UPON HIS HEAD
CANST THOU TELL ME WHAT MY SEVEN FOALS EAT AND DRINK AND THE YOUTH SHOWED HIM THE BIT OF MOSS AND THE BOTTLE OF WATER AND SAID
AGAIN DID THE PRINCE SIT DOWN ON THE STONE WEEP AND WEEP AND THEN GO TO SLEEP
AFTER WHICH THE LORDS AND COOKS FORMED THEMSELVES IN LINES AND TUBBY BETROTHED DESIRE TO ZIZI
YES I WILL BRUSH YOU WITH PLEASURE SAID THE GIRL AND SET TO WORK WITH THE TANGLED HAIR AND AS MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED THIS TOO WAS BY NO MEANS PLEASANT WORK
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STEAL THE SHEET OFF OUR BED AND MY WIFE'S NIGHT-GOWN SAID THE GOVERNOR
THAT IS ALL THE WILD BEASTS IN THE FOREST SAID DAPPLEGRIM
WHEN HIS HUNGER WAS SATISFIED THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIM
AND AFTERWARDS THREE WEDDINGS WERE CELEBRATED
BUT WHEN THE MAN ONCE MORE SAW THIS HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHAT A BAD BUSINESS THIS IS
THEN HE GREW WEARY AND SAID
NOW IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT A KING WHO WAS HUNTING IN THE WOOD HAD A LARGE GREYHOUND WHO RAN SNIFFING TO THE TREE ON WHICH THE GIRL SAT AND JUMPED ROUND IT YELPING AND BARKING FURIOUSLY
WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THE KING'S SON STEPPED IN AMONG THE CROWD AND CRIED
AND NOW HE ONCE MORE ASKED AFTER WHITELAND AND THE MAN SUMMONED ALL THE BIRDS TOGETHER AND INQUIRED IF ANY OF THEM KNEW WHERE WHITELAND LAY
WE NEVER GET ANYTHING BUT HARD DRY CRUSTS TO EAT--WHY THE DOG UNDER THE TABLE IS BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE
THE KING SENT HER A LETTER EVERY DAY BUT AT LAST ONE MORNING AS SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE PALACE WINDOW SHE SAW A MESSENGER APPROACHING IN HOT HASTE
WHEN THE BAGPIPER HAD THUS CONCLUDED HIS BUSINESS HE WENT TO BED AT HIS INN
BUT THE OLD FOLKS STUCK TO WHAT THEY HAD SAID AND TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS TO GO TO THE FARM WHERE HE COULD GET BOTH MEAT AND DRINK WHEREAS THEY THEMSELVES HAD NOT EVEN A CHAIR TO OFFER HIM
MY LORD HAVE MERCY BURCHARD THE WOLF TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD AND PASSED ON
THEY UNLACED HER BODICE COMBED HER HAIR WASHED HER WITH WATER AND WINE BUT ALL IN VAIN
YOU LEAVE IT TO ME LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR SAID THE CITIZENS ONE TO ANOTHER
SHE GAVE NO ANSWER BUT NODDED SLIGHTLY WITH HER HEAD
THERE LAY THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER THEN LIKE A BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER AND COULD NOT STIR THOUGH HER HEART WAS CONSUMED WITH GRIEF
AFTER THE MARRIAGE THE PIG AND HIS BRIDE SET OUT FOR HIS HOME IN ONE OF THE ROYAL CARRIAGES
THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH A NUMBER OF COCKCHAFERS AND THE BUZZING WAS SO LOUD THAT THE KING WAS AFRAID HE SHOULD BE DEAFENED BY IT
HE COULD NEITHER LIVE NOR DIE
HE IS A CAPITAL HORSE TO RIDE BUT GOOD FOR NOTHING AT DRAWING
HE SANK LOWER AND LOWER AND AT LAST HE CAME TO THE BOTTOM
REYNARD REYNARD COME OUT OF YOUR EARTH OR DRAKESTAIL'S LIFE IS OF LITTLE WORTH THEN FRIEND FOX WHO WAS ONLY WAITING FOR THESE WORDS HASTENS OUT THROWS HIMSELF ON THE WICKED FOWLS AND QUICK
AND AS SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS VERY FAST SHE CAUGHT HER FOOT IN HER DRESS AND FELL FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM AND BROKE HER NECK
THEN ALL HE BIRDS BROKE OUT SINGING
THE KING AND THE PRINCESS WERE SO HAPPY THAT THEY FREELY FORGAVE THEM AND AS FOR THE GOOD OLD MAN HE WAS SPLENDIDLY REWARDED AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS DAYS IN THE PALACE
SO ONE DAY GUDRUN'S WITCH MOTHER PUT POPPY AND FORGETFUL DRUGS IN A MAGICAL CUP AND BADE SIGURD DRINK TO HER HEALTH AND HE DRANK AND INSTANTLY HE FORGOT POOR BRYNHILD AND HE LOVED GUDRUN AND THEY WERE MARRIED WITH GREAT REJOICINGS
HALVOR COULD TAKE NO REST AND WANTED TO SET OFF IMMEDIATELY
OUR MAYBLOSSOM WILL BE HAPPY IN SPITE OF HER PREDICTIONS AND THE QUEEN LAUGHED UNTIL SHE WAS TIRED AT THE IDEA OF HAVING OUTWITTED THE OLD FAIRY
BUT YOU NEED BE UNDER NO CONCERN ABOUT FOOD FOR IN MY LEFT EAR THERE LIES A CLOTH AND IF YOU WILL BUT TAKE IT AND SPREAD IT OUT YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY DISHES AS YOU LIKE SO SHE DID THIS AND TOOK THE CLOTH AND SPREAD IT OUT UPON THE GRASS AND THEN IT WAS COVERED WITH THE DAINTIEST DISHES THAT ANY ONE COULD DESIRE AND THERE WAS WINE AND MEAD AND CAKE
I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE NOT TO CALL ME UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE UTMOST NEED HE SAID TO MINNIKIN AND THERE IS NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A MIDGE HERE WHO CAN DO YOU ANY HARM AND WITH THAT HE GAVE MINNIKIN SUCH A BLOW THAT HE ROLLED OVER ON THE GRASS
I WILL WATCH MYSELF TO-NIGHT BY THE CHILD'S BED WHEN THE EVENING CAME HE WENT TO THE NURSERY AND AT MIDNIGHT THE QUEEN APPEARED AND SAID
I'M NOT YOUR SERVANT WHEN SHE SAW THAT THEY DID NOT MEAN TO GIVE HER ANYTHING SHE LEFT THE HOUSE IN NO AMIABLE FRAME OF MIND
I HAD RETREATED BUT A FEW PACES WHEN I OBSERVED BETWEEN ME AND THE LIGHT THE FIGURE OF A TALL BLACK MAN STANDING IN THE ENTRANCE
THE COUNT ALONE IS GUILTY OF HIS OWN DEATH LET US WAIT A LITTLE
WHAT A SMELL OF CHRISTIAN MAN'S BLOOD SAID THE TROLL
AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM AND SAID
SO THE MAN GAVE HIM A PAIR OF SNOW SHOES
OH MY GOLD AND MY SILVER AND MY BEST CLOTHES SHRIEKED THE PRIEST AND WILD WITH RAGE HE RAN HOME SO FAST THAT THE GOOSE-GIRL THOUGHT HE HAD SUDDENLY GONE MAD
I'LL COME BACK ONCE AND THEN FAREWELL AND SHE NURSED AND PETTED THE CHILD AS USUAL BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED
SHE ROSE UP AND WANDERED THROUGH THIS ENCHANTED PLACE TILL SHE CAME TO A BAKER'S OVEN FULL OF BREAD AND THE BREAD CALLED OUT TO HER AS SHE PASSED
I CONSENT ALSO SAID THE QUEEN
I THINK YOU MUST BE MAKING FUN OF ME REPLIED THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS
SHE TRIED TO BE SURE TO PICK UP THE GRAINS OF BARLEY BUT SHE SOON SAW HOW USELESS HER LABOUR WAS
I SHOULD KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH SAID THE OLD WOMAN RISING
THEN KOSHCHEI ENTREATED PRINCE IVAN SAYING
BEING IN GREAT FEAR AND NOT KNOWING HOW TO PASS I FIRED A PISTOL AT HIM AND HE IMMEDIATELY FELL ACROSS THE ENTRANCE
AFTER THEY HAD LIVED LIKE THIS FOR A FEW YEARS IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT A PRINCE WAS RIDING THROUGH THE WOOD AND PASSED BY THE TOWER
LEAVE WITH US A SILVER FORK
HE WAS DELIGHTED AND HE SEIZED THEM AND CARRIED THEM OFF TO THE KING
FOR HE IS A MONSTROUS GIANT WITH BUT ONE EYE ON HIS FOREHEAD WHO LIVES ON HUMAN FLESH
THE KING LOOKED AT IT IN SILENCE A LONG TIME BUT AT LAST HE SAID
SHE MANAGED TOO TO MAKE HER FIGURE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE LOOK LIKE THE QUEEN'S BUT EVEN HER POWER COULD NOT RESTORE THE EYE SHE HAD LOST
SO HE BRIBED A FALSE SERVANT TO LET HIM INSIDE THE CASTLE WHEN THE KNIGHT WAS IN BED AND ASLEEP AND HE KILLED HIM AS HE LAY
A BARGAIN
SHE HAD TO CROSS SWAMPS AND TO SCALE MOUNTAIN PEAKS COVERED WITH FLINTS SO THAT HER FEET AND KNEES AND ELBOWS WERE ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND SOMETIMES SHE CAME TO A PRECIPICE ACROSS WHICH SHE COULD NOT JUMP AND SHE HAD TO CRAWL ROUND ON HANDS AND KNEES HELPING HERSELF ALONG WITH HER STAFF
AND THE MASTER HAVING HANDED OVER THE CLOTHES WENT HOME BUT HE NO LONGER FOUND HIS DEAR JOURNEYMAN THERE
AGAIN THE KING'S SON CAME OUT TO MEET HER TIED HER HORSE TO A PILLAR AND LED HER INTO THE BANQUETING HALL
NOW THEIR CRUEL STEPMOTHER WAS IN REALITY A WITCH AND SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE TWO CHILDREN HAD RUN AWAY
AND DAPPLEGRIM AND THE HORSE BEGAN TO FIGHT UNTIL THE STONES LEAPT UP TO THE SKY
TO WHITELAND SAID THE KING AND THEN HE RELATED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
GO INTO MY WARDROBE
AND HIS FATHER HAD THREE SONS--THE FIRST WAS FAFNIR THE DRAGON
THAT CREATURE SAID THE OTHERS
WELL NOW YOU'VE BEEN OUT IN THE WOOD ALL THE DAY AND I'VE STAYED QUIETLY AT HOME AND ALL THE SAME I KNOW MORE THAN YOU DO THEN TELL US THEY CRIED
THIS HE DID AND SHE WENT BACK TO PERCINET WHO WAS WAITING FOR HER AND THEY SET OUT TOGETHER FOR THE PALACE
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ON THE TWELFTH DAY WHEN THE TURN CAME TO BENJAMIN HE NOTICED A FLAG WAVING IN THE AIR BUT ALAS
HE AT ONCE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY THE PRINCESS'S FAULT AND GAVE ORDERS THAT SHE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN THE TOWER IN PRINCE CURLICUE'S PLACE
ISN'T THERE A QUICKER WAY OF KNOWING THAN THAT VERY WELL SAID PERCINET YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF SO UP THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE TOP OF A VERY HIGH TOWER WHICH LIKE THE REST OF THE CASTLE WAS BUILT ENTIRELY OF ROCK-CRYSTAL
WHO KNOWS WHAT MISCHIEF SHE IS UP TO
IF I COULD ONLY THINK OF SOME WAY OF ESCAPING AS SHE SPOKE SHE SAW THE LITTLE MOUSE PLAYING IN A CORNER WITH SOME LONG STRAWS
WAS I WRONG MY LOVELY ZIZI THIS TIME IT WAS ZIZI'S TURN TO BE SILENT
THEN WE SHALL DO WELL TO FLY ON A LITTLE FARTHER SAID THE EAGLE AND OFF IT SET
DON'T LET THE LIGHT GET INTO THE QUEEN'S EYES
HE HAD HEARD THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD THERE WERE GIRLS WHOSE NECKS WERE WHITE AND WHOSE HANDS WERE SMALL WHO WERE ALWAYS DRESSED IN THE FINEST SILKS AND LACES AND WERE CALLED PRINCESSES AND WHILE HIS COMPANIONS ROUND THE FIRE SAW NOTHING IN THE FLAMES BUT COMMON EVERYDAY FANCIES HE DREAMED THAT HE HAD THE HAPPINESS TO MARRY A PRINCESS
SHE MUST BE KEPT PERFECTLY QUIET SO THE KING WENT AWAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT IT WAS A FALSE QUEEN WHO LAY IN THE BED
THEN THEY SET OUT AGAIN TO FINISH THEIR JOURNEY AND THIS TIME AS THEY KNEW THE WAY THEY WERE NOT LONG UPON THE ROAD
CAN YOU FIGHT SCREAMED THE TROLL
YOU MUST PROMISE ME NOT TO LET THE DUCHESS SEE HOW MUCH YOU DISLIKE HER AT FIRST THE PRINCESS WOULD NOT PROMISE BUT THE NURSE SHOWED HER SO MANY GOOD REASONS FOR IT THAT IN THE END SHE AGREED TO BE AMIABLE TO HER STEP-MOTHER
AS SHE WAS AS CROSS AS SHE WAS UGLY SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR EVERYONE SAYING HOW PRETTY AND HOW CHARMING GRACIOSA WAS
TAKE IT AND CARRY IT ABOUT IN THE OPEN AIR
I CAN DO THAT SAID MINNIKIN
THE KING DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK TO HER BUT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE KEPT WATCH AGAIN
AND OFF SHE WENT WITH THE CAKE QUITE PROUD OF HER ERRAND
THAT'S A FULL-GROWN COLT SAID DAPPLEGRIM IF YOU HEAR IT SO PLAINLY WHEN IT IS SO FAR AWAY FROM US SO THEY TRAVELLED ONWARDS A LONG TIME AND SAW ONE NEW SCENE AFTER ANOTHER ONCE MORE
WHO'S BEEN CUTTING WITH MY LITTLE KNIFE THE SEVENTH SAID
BUT TINY AS HE WAS HE HAD BRAINS AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT FOR HAVING BEGUN WITH NOTHING HE ENDED BY AMASSING A HUNDRED CROWNS
IS THAT YOU HALVOR SAID SHE AND SUCH GREAT GLADNESS FELL ON THE OLD PARENTS THAT THERE WERE NO BOUNDS TO IT
ONE DAY HE WAS WANDERING THROUGH A WOOD ALL BY HIMSELF THINKING NOW OF ONE THING NOW OF ANOTHER TILL THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE LEFT TO THINK ABOUT
HE HARDLY HAD COURAGE TO OPEN HIS LAST ORANGE
THE CHILD WAS DEAD AND REMAINED DEAD
WHO'S BEEN LYING ON MY BED THE OTHERS CAME RUNNING ROUND AND CRIED WHEN THEY SAW THEIR BEDS
BUT DIRECTLY HE TOUCHED HER HE HUNG ON HIMSELF AND HAD TO RUN ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEM
IT IS NOT FAR OFF YOU CAN SEE THE CHIMNEY-POTS FROM HERE AND THERE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF EVERYTHING HALVOR WOULD NOT HEAR OF THAT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO STAY WHERE HE WAS
I HAD BETTER AWAY WITH MY GIFT FOR THE INFANT THEN AND SO SAYING SHE SET OUT
THEN THE ADMIRAL SAID
SHE MADE NO ANSWER BUT CONTINUED TO WEEP
PRINCE IVAN WAS LEFT ALONE
NO SOONER HAD SHE OPENED IT THAN WITH A SHUDDER OF HORROR SHE TRIED TO THROW IT DOWN BUT FOUND THAT SOME MYSTERIOUS POWER COMPELLED HER TO HOLD IT AGAINST HER WILL
HIS JOY WAS GREAT WHEN HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL WELL FOR THE YOUNGEST DID HER BEST NOT TO APPEAR SAD
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPLENDID THAN THE AMBASSADOR'S ATTIRE
AND THEN THEY ALL WENT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD TO BE HOISTED INTO THE UPPER WORLD
BUT MARYA MOREVNA HE CARRIED OFF HOME
WHEN THEY SAW THE NEW-COMER AND HOW HE WAS MADE AND WHEN THEY HEARD HIM CRYING TOO THEY BEGAN TO LOOK BLACK AT HIM
NO SOONER DID IT HEAR THE SOUNDS OF HUNTING IN THE FOREST THAN IT CRIED
BUT BLANCHETTE PROMISED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT SHE WOULD NEVER MORE STOP TO LISTEN TO A WOLF SO THAT AT LAST THE MOTHER FORGAVE HER
SHE DID NOT TOUCH THE SOUP BUT SHE CARRIED THE BONES TO THE EDGE OF THE FIELD AND BURIED THEM THERE
FOR THE PRINCE HAD GONE TO A SHOEMAKER'S AND HIM TOO HE SENT TO WORK FOR THE KING
EACH PUT THEIR BAGS OF GOLD UNDER THEIR HEADS AS IF TO SLEEP
NOW BURCHARD HAD SUCH A WICKED CRUEL HEART THAT IT WAS WHISPERED HOW HE USED TO HARNESS HIS PEASANTS TO THE PLOUGH AND FORCE THEM BY BLOWS FROM HIS WHIP TO TILL HIS LAND WITH NAKED FEET
HOWEVER THE DUCHESS THOUGHT SHE MUST BE BLACK AND BLUE AFTER SUCH A BEATING
AND A SECOND TIME I WILL FORGIVE YOU
SCARCELY HAD THEY ENTERED THE PALACE WHEN THE THUNDER CRASHED THE ROOF BURST INTO A BLAZE THE CEILING SPLIT IN TWAIN AND IN FLEW AN EAGLE
NEXT MORNING AS THE DAY DAWNED DESIRE WENT DOWN TO THE STABLE AND SADDLED HIS PRETTY WHITE HORSE
IF ANY ONE HAS THESE THREE THINGS HE CAN MAKE HIMSELF INVISIBLE AND IF HE DESIRES TO GO TO ANY PLACE HE HAS BUT TO WISH AND HE IS THERE
SHE DID THIS AND THEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF AGAIN BUT THEY HAD TO STAY THERE AND REST FOR A WEEK BEFORE THE BULL WAS ABLE TO GO ANY FARTHER
WHEN SHE SET IT DOWN BEFORE HIM HE SWORE IT SMELLED LIKE SWINE'S FLESH BUT KNOWING WHERE TO FIND THE FINGER SHE IMMEDIATELY TURNED IT UP WHICH FAIRLY CONVINCED HIM OF THE CONTRARY
I WILL GO AND SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME WILD FRUIT FOR YOU I WISH YOU MIGHT FIND A WOLF TO EAT YOU UP GROWLED FANFARONADE
NOT VERY FAR OFF THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD THREE OXEN ONE OF WHICH HE WAS TO TAKE TO THE TOWN TO SELL
WHEN THE AUDIENCE HALL WAS QUITE FULL THE FAIRY SAID TO THE SUBJECTS OF THE WICKED KING THAT IF THEY WOULD ACCEPT DELICIA WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE JOLLY KING AS THEIR QUEEN SHE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO FIND A SUITABLE HUSBAND FOR HER AND WOULD PROMISE THAT DURING THEIR REIGN THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING BUT REJOICING AND MERRY-MAKING AND ALL DISMAL THINGS SHOULD BE ENTIRELY BANISHED
THE KING'S SON CARRIED MY DAUGHTER FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER
BUT WHEN CROWDS OF PEOPLE WENT OUT FROM THE TOWN TO EXAMINE THE ILL-FATED PIT THAT HAD SWALLOWED UP SUCH NUMBERS AND YET NEVER SEEMED TO BE FULL THEY COULD DISCOVER NOTHING
THE EARTH BEGAN TO SHAKE AND THE NORKA CAME RUSHING UP AND BURST RIGHT THROUGH THE FENCE INTO THE PARK SO HUGE WAS IT
NOW I'LL JUST SHOOT HIM THAT I WILL SO HE TOOK UP A RIFLE WHICH HE HAD LAID AT HIS BEDSIDE
THEN WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME HE GRASPED THE SWORD AND STRUCK THE TROLL DEAD AND IN THE MORNING WHEN HE WENT OUT OF THE CASTLE THE PRINCESSES WERE STANDING THERE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE EARTH
MIRROR MIRROR HANGING THERE WHO IN ALL THE LAND'S MOST FAIR AND THIS TIME IT REPLIED
PRINCE IVAN SAID TO HIS YOUNGEST SISTER
THEY PUT HIM IN THE RIGHT WAY AND WHEN HE CAME IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE IT WAS SO FULL OF HORSES AND PEOPLE THAT IT SWARMED WITH THEM
SHE RAN AS FAR AS HER LEGS WOULD CARRY HER AND AS EVENING APPROACHED SHE SAW A LITTLE HOUSE AND SHE STEPPED INSIDE TO REST
SO SHE LAY DOWN UPON IT SAID HER PRAYERS LIKE A GOOD CHILD AND FELL FAST ASLEEP
THESE FEATHERS WERE ALL MIXED UP IN SUCH CONFUSION THAT THE BIRDS THEMSELVES COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN OUT THEIR OWN
AND NOW ALL HAPPENED JUST AS IT HAD HAPPENED TWICE ALREADY
BUT THE MORE THEY SAID THE MORE DETERMINED SHE WAS AND AT LAST THEY CONSENTED TO MAKE A TINY HOLE IN THE TOWER ON THE SIDE THAT LOOKED TOWARDS THE CITY GATES
THE KING ORDERED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SEIZED AND BOUND WITH ROPES AND FRISK ALSO
THE QUEEN FELT THAT SHE HAD REALLY COME TO THE END OF HER MISFORTUNES AT LAST AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.(10 10 LA BONNE VETITE SOURIS PAR MADAME D'AULNOY
YOU MUST ONLY DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU OF COURSE I WILL REPLIED THE WOLF
PRAY TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HERE MADAM THEY ANSWERED WE ARE SENT FOR AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE PERSON CALLED DELICIA ALAS SAID SHE THAT IS MY NAME
AT LAST SAID THE POOR CHAP GOING UP THE GREAT STAIRS THEY HAVE DECIDED TO RECEIVE ME IMAGINE HIS TERROR WHEN ON ENTERING HE SEES THE KING AS RED AS A TURKEY COCK AND ALL HIS MINISTERS ATTENDING HIM STANDING SWORD IN HAND
HAVING THE HATCHET MADE SHE FELL TO CUTTING DOWN THE TREE AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR IT BEGAN TO SHAKE WITH ME
LONG HAVE I AWAITED THEE HE MOUNTED THE HORSE AND RODE ON--RODE AND RODE UNTIL HE SAW STANDING BEFORE HIM A PALACE MADE OF COPPER
ALL THE NAMES IN THE CALENDAR ARE TAKEN ALREADY WELL SAID THE FATHER I WILL THINK ABOUT IT WITH YOU AS NEITHER MOTHER NOR DAUGHTER NOR FATHER CAME UPSTAIRS AGAIN THE LOVER GREW IMPATIENT AND WENT DOWN INTO THE CELLAR TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD ALL BE DOING
JUST DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU THAT I WILL SAID THE HARE YOU WILL FIND ME A MOST ATTENTIVE PUPIL THEY WENT ON A BIT TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO A THIN PART OF THE WOOD WHERE THEY FOUND AN ASPEN TREE GROWING
AND IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS AND THEY ALL PROFFERED HIM THANKS INASMUCH AS THROUGH HIM THEY WERE ENRICHED BY THE KING
THEIR LOVELINESS WAS OF EVERY KIND
JUST THEN THE TROLL WITH NINE HEADS CAME AND HE WAS SO FRIGHTFUL THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER SCARCELY DARED TO LOOK AT HIM WHO IS THIS WHO IS BREAKING MY WOOD HE SCREAMED IT IS AS MUCH MINE AS YOURS SAID THE BULL
HE SEEMS TO BE THE CAPTAIN AND LOOKS AS IF HE HAD COME THROUGH MANY TOILS I WAS AS NEAR DEATH ONCE AS THE PRINCE IS YET SAYS THE BLACK THIEF AND ESCAPED
HERE THEY GOT INTO A LITTLE BOAT IN WHICH THE POOR OLD BOATMAN WAS SLEEPING AND WHEN HE WOKE UP AND SAW THE LOVELY PRINCESS WITH ALL HER DIAMONDS AND HER SPIDERS'--WEB SCARF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND OBEYED HER INSTANTLY WHEN SHE COMMANDED HIM TO SET OUT
LET HIM CUT OFF REGIN'S HEAD AND KEEP ALL THE GOLD TO HIMSELF THE FOURTH BIRD SAID
NOW SAYS THE HEN-WIFE YOU MUST MAKE A BARGAIN THAT IF YOU WIN THEY MUST DO WHATEVER YOU COMMAND THEM AND IF THEY WIN THAT YOU MUST DO WHATEVER THEY COMMAND YOU TO DO
SO SHE TOLD HER TO SIT AT THE WELL AND SPIN
I PITY THIS YOUTH AND DO NOT WANT TO PUT HIM TO DEATH IF I COULD HELP IT THAT HAPPENS WELL SAYS THE THIEF OF SLOAN FOR I LIKE HIM BEST MYSELF AND HAVE RESERVED THE MOST CURIOUS PASSAGE FOR THE LAST ON HIS ACCOUNT WELL THEN SAYS THE KNIGHT LET US HEAR IT I WAS ONE DAY ON MY TRAVELS SAYS THE BLACK THIEF AND I CAME INTO A LARGE FOREST WHERE I WANDERED A LONG TIME AND COULD NOT GET OUT OF IT
ONE DAY THEY SENT HER TO THE BROOK TO FETCH SOME WATER HOME AND AN UGLY AND HORRIBLE HEAD ROSE UP OUT OF THE WATER AND SAID WASH ME GIRL YES I WILL WASH YOU WITH PLEASURE SAID THE GIRL AND BEGAN TO WASH AND SCRUB THE UGLY FACE BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT IT WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT PIECE OF WORK
BUT DEAR BRYNHILD LIVE AND BE COMFORTED AND LOVE GUNNAR THY HUSBAND AND I WILL GIVE THEE ALL THE GOLD THE TREASURE OF THE DRAGON FAFNIR BRYNHILD SAID
SO WHEN THE MAN'S DAUGHTER WENT HOME LOOKING AS BEAUTIFUL AND BRIGHT AS DAY THE STEP-MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER GREW MUCH MORE ILL-TEMPERED AND IT WAS WORSE STILL WHEN SHE BEGAN TO TALK AND THEY SAW THAT GOLDEN COINS DROPPED FROM HER MOUTH
THE PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK FELT VERY FORLORN WHEN SHE WAS GONE AND BEGAN TO THINK THAT IT WAS QUITE TIME HER FATHER SENT AN ARMY TO RESCUE HER
AS SOON AS THE KING SAW THE ROE HE SAID TO HIS HUNTSMAN NOW THEN GIVE CHASE TO IT ALL DAY TILL EVENING BUT MIND AND BE CAREFUL NOT TO HURT IT WHEN THE SUN HAD SET THE KING SAID TO HIS HUNTSMAN NOW COME AND SHOW ME THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE WOOD AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND SAID MY SISTER DEAR OPEN
SHE LOOKED ALL ABOUT FOR PERCINET BUT HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
SO HALVOR WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND DID NOT LINGER THERE EITHER BUT WENT STRAIGHT IN
THEN THERE CAME A TIME WHEN HE MADE WAR ON ANOTHER KING AND WENT AWAY TO FIGHT AND THEN THE NEW QUEEN THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD DO WHAT SHE LIKED
NOBODY WAS TO BE SEEN BUT ON LEAVING THE HALL THEY FOUND THE BODY OF THE GIANTESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
BUT THERE MUST BE WOMEN SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD WHO ARE NEITHER PINK NOR WHITE AND I TELL YOU ONCE FOR ALL THAT I WILL NEVER MARRY UNTIL I HAVE FOUND ONE EXACTLY TO MY TASTE II SOME TIME AFTERWARDS IT HAPPENED THAT THE PRIOR OF THE ABBEY OF SAINT AMAND SENT TO THE LORD OF AVESNES A BASKET OF ORANGES WITH A BEAUTIFULLY-WRITTEN LETTER SAYING THAT THESE GOLDEN FRUIT THEN UNKNOWN IN FLANDERS CAME STRAIGHT FROM A LAND WHERE THE SUN ALWAYS SHONE
AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN
SHE THEN THREW AWAY HER SECOND PAIR OF SHOES WHICH WERE QUITE WORN OUT AND WITH HER CHILD ON HER ARM AND HER STAFF IN HER HAND SHE SET FORTH ON HER WAY TO THE WIND
AND AFTERWARDS THEY WENT OFF TO THEIR OWN REALM.(3 3 RALSTON
AND IT WAS BETTER THAT HE DIDN'T FOR THE ROBBERS CAME AND THE OLD WOMAN SAID THAT A YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS A STRANGER HAD COME THERE AND SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET HIM TO GO AWAY AGAIN
GOOD-DAY MOTHER WHAT HAVE YOU TO SELL GOOD WARES FINE WARES SHE ANSWERED
A TROLL WITH SIX HEADS LIVES HERE WHO IS THE OWNER OF THE WOOD AND I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO OVERCOME HIM YES SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE NOT TO TOUCH WHAT YOU DO NOT WISH ME TO TOUCH BUT WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE WOOD IT WAS SO CROWDED AND THE TREES SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY GET FORWARD
SO JACK TURNED HIMSELF INTO A DOVE AND FARMER WEATHERBEARD TURNED HIMSELF INTO A HAWK AND FLEW AFTER THE DOVE AND STRUCK IT
AND SHE HAS MANY OTHER SPLENDID MARES
HE LOOKED SO UGLY AND CROSS THAT ALL HIS SUBJECTS FEARED HIM AND HE HATED THE VERY SIGHT OF A CHEERFUL FACE
THEN IT WAS FASTENED DOWN SECURELY AND THE BARREL WAS ROLLED DOWN THE HILL TILL IT FELL INTO THE RIVER.(19 19 GRIMM
THE MASTER COOK HIMSELF MOUNTED TO THE HALL TO MAKE HIS EXCUSES AND TO BEG HIS LORD TO HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE
THE LIGHTNING FLASHED THE THUNDER ROARED THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
SO THE MASTER THIEF WENT TO A SHOP AND BOUGHT ENOUGH BRANDY TO FILL TWO POCKET FLASKS AND HE PUT A SLEEPING DRINK INTO ONE OF THESE BUT INTO THE OTHER HE POURED BRANDY ONLY
SNOWDROP WHO DWELLS WITH THE SEVEN LITTLE MEN IS AS FAIR AS YOU AS FAIR AGAIN WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS SHE LITERALLY TREMBLED AND SHOOK WITH RAGE
NOW MY FINE LADY YOU'RE REALLY DONE FOR THIS TIME SAID THE WICKED WOMAN AND SHE MADE HER WAY HOME AS FAST AS SHE COULD
IN THE MEANTIME THE KING WON A GREAT VICTORY AND HAVING COMPLETELY DEFEATED AND DRIVEN OFF THE ENEMY HE HURRIED HOME TO HIS DAUGHTERS TO WHOM HIS THOUGHTS HAD CONSTANTLY TURNED
THEY WENT UP ALOFT AND THEN HE TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
FAREWELL
DEPEND UPON IT THE OLD PEDDLER WIFE WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE OLD QUEEN
BUT HER HOUSE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES OFF GO THE NEAREST WAY YOU WILL THE MAN SET OUT AND GOT THERE AT NIGHT
BUT GRACIOSA HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GUESSING THAT IT WAS PERCINET
BUT HE HELD OUT UNTIL THE TROLL WAS DONE WITH HIM AND THEN HE TOOK THE FLASK AND RUBBED HIMSELF
YOU KNOW OUR SECRET!--KEEP IT
SOME TIME HAD PASSED AWAY--WHO CAN TELL HOW LONG THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE?--WHEN THE WITCH TO WHOM A CHILD HAD BEEN BORN IN THE MEANTIME BEGAN TO TAKE AN ILL-WILL TO THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND TO TORMENT HER IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS
BUT SAID SHE MIND YOU COME BACK IN THE EVENING
THEN THE LADY TURNED TO PRINCE CURLICUE AND SAID
HE CAME MORE RARELY TO LOCQUIGNOL AND VERY SOON HE DID NOT COME AT ALL
QUICK
BE FIRM HAPPEN WHAT MAY AND SEEK THE GOLDEN BRANCH THUS ENCOURAGED THE PRINCE PERSEVERED IN HIS REFUSAL AND AT LENGTH THE OLD FAIRY IN A FURY CRIED
AND WHY SEND ME IN A PAPER DRESS
ONE FINE DAY AN ENORMOUS PIG FROM THE NORTH WALKED INTO THE PALACE AND GOING STRAIGHT UP TO THE KING SAID HAIL
IN ONE OF THE ROOMS A DINNER WAS LAID OUT
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE MOUNTAIN INTO WHICH THE PRINCESS HAD BEEN CARRIED THE DIFFICULTY WAS TO ASCEND THE PRECIPITOUS WALL OF ROCK BY WHICH HE WAS TO GET ON TO THE MOUNTAIN BEYOND FOR THE ROCK STOOD RIGHT UP ON END AS STEEP AS A HOUSE SIDE AND AS SMOOTH AS A SHEET OF GLASS
SO HE WENT UP INTO THE TURRET AND BEGAN TO SEARCH ABOUT AND TAP UPON THE WALLS AND ALL AT ONCE HE CAME UPON A PLACE THAT SOUNDED HOLLOW
OH I YOU ARE NOT TELLING ME THE TRUTH FOR I HAVE YOUR RING HERE IN MY PURSE THEN THE QUEEN WAS VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND SHE SAW THAT THE KING WAS VEXED WITH HER
INSTEAD OF FALLING UPON BLANCHETTE HE CAME FRISKING UP TO HER LIKE A GOOD DOG
THEN DULLHEAD CLAIMED HER AS HIS BRIDE BUT THE KING WHO DID NOT MUCH FANCY HIM AS A SON-IN-LAW MADE ALL SORTS OF OBJECTIONS AND TOLD HIM HE MUST FIRST FIND A MAN WHO COULD DRINK UP A WHOLE CELLARFUL OF WINE
COME AND SLEEP A BIT WITH YOUR HEAD IN MY LAP SHE SAID TO MINNIKIN AND AS HE SLEPT SHE PUT A GOLDEN DRESS ON HIM
WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE CRIED
IN RETURN ASK OF ME ANYTHING THOU DESIREST
HA
THE TWELVE BROTHERS THERE WERE ONCE UPON A TIME A KING AND A QUEEN WHO LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER AND THEY HAD TWELVE CHILDREN ALL OF WHOM WERE BOYS
HE POOR MAN SEEMED TURNED TO STONE AS HE GAZED AFTER HER HURRYING AWAY FROM HIM AND CALLING AT THE TOP OF HER VOICE AS SHE RAN
OH PRINCE IVAN
WEST WIND
WEST WIND
OH NO SAID THE LAD
SO GRACIOSA WHEN SHE WAS RELEASED PRETENDED TO FEEL VERY BAD AND WENT AWAY INTO HER OWN ROOM WHERE SHE TOLD HER NURSE ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEN THE NURSE LEFT HER AND WHEN THE PRINCESS TURNED ROUND THERE STOOD PERCINET BESIDE HER
HOW OUR BOAT DOES ROCK UPON THE WATER
IF A MIDDLE-AGED MAN MY BROTHER
IT WILL NOW COST US A BATTLE FOR LIFE OR DEATH
THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT WAS COMING ON AND WHEN THE FATHER AND MOTHER SAW SUCH A SPLENDID AND STATELY STRANGER WALK IN THEY WERE SO STARTLED THAT THEY BOTH BEGAN TO BOW AND CURTSEY
NOW ONE DAY WHEN THE KING WAS OUT AND NOBODY ELSE NEAR THE BAD WOMAN TOOK THE QUEEN BY HER HEAD AND THE DAUGHTER TOOK HER BY HER HEELS AND THEY DRAGGED HER FROM HER BED AND FLUNG HER OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE STREAM WHICH FLOWED BENEATH IT
FOR THE STEED IS ALL THE WATCH THE KNIGHT KEEPS THERE ACCORDINGLY IN THE DEAD HOUR OF THE NIGHT THE KING'S THREE SONS AND THE THIEF OF SLOAN ATTEMPTED THE STEED OF BELLS IN ORDER TO CARRY HIM AWAY BUT BEFORE THEY COULD REACH THE STABLES THE STEED NEIGHED MOST TERRIBLY AND SHOOK HIMSELF SO AND THE BELLS RUNG WITH SUCH NOISE THAT THE KNIGHT AND ALL HIS MEN WERE UP IN A MOMENT
SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PLENTY TO EAT IN THAT COUNTRY AND SINCE THAT TIME TOO YOU SEE IN THE MIDST OF THE FAIR-HAIRED BLUE-EYED WOMEN OF FLANDERS A FEW BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WHOSE EYES ARE BLACK AND WHOSE SKINS ARE THE COLOUR OF GOLD
YOU ARE SHARPER THAN I AM FOR THAT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME AND HAVING FOUND THREE PEOPLE MORE FOOLISH THAN HIS BRIDE OR HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER THE LOVER WENT BACK TO MARRY THE YOUNG LADY
DURING THIS TIME THE MUSICIAN HAD ONCE MORE PLAYED HIS FIDDLE AND HAD BEEN MORE FORTUNATE IN THE RESULT
IN SHORT THEY RAN AND TOOK THE CROWN OFF THE HEAD OF THE DECEASED AND PLACED IT ON THAT OF DRAKESTAIL WHOM IT FITTED LIKE WAX
IF I GIVE BIRTH TO A LITTLE SON I WILL WAVE A WHITE FLAG AND THEN YOU MAY SAFELY RETURN
THE ENCHANTED CANARY I ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE REIGN OF KING CAMBRINUS THERE LIVED AT AVESNES ONE OF HIS LORDS WHO WAS THE FINEST MAN--BY WHICH I MEAN THE FATTEST--IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY OF FLANDERS
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING ASKED THE BULL
WHEN THE TROLL GOT HIS FIRST HEAD IN HE CRIED
I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE A FOAL NEIGHING QUITE PLAINLY A LONG LONG WAY OFF ANSWERED THE YOUTH
THE COUNT HAD CEASED TO PERSECUTE HER BUT HE STILL REFUSED HIS CONSENT TO THE MARRIAGE
WHAT ARE YOU WEEPING FOR SAID THE BULL
SO SHE STEPPED INTO THE CARRIAGE AND DROVE AWAY WITH THE KING AND WHEN THEY REACHED HIS PALACE THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH MUCH SPLENDOUR
WHAT WOULDN'T I GIVE TO HAVE A CHILD AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BLACK AS EBONY AND HER WISH WAS GRANTED FOR NOT LONG AFTER A LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS BORN TO HER WITH A SKIN AS WHITE AS SNOW LIPS AND CHEEKS AS RED AS BLOOD AND HAIR AS BLACK AS EBONY
CAN THEY ALL HAVE BEEN SO HEAVY-HEARTED THAT THEY HAVE ALL THREE HANGED THEMSELVES
THE SOUNDS PIERCED TO THE EARS OF A POOR WOODMAN WHO INSTANTLY LEFT HIS WORK AND WITH HIS HATCHET UNDER HIS ARM CAME TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
THERE WAS ONCE A LITTLE PEASANT GIRL PRETTY AND NICE AS A STAR IN ITS SEASON
LATER IN THE DAY THE MASTER THIEF CAME AND RELATED WHAT HE HAD DONE AND WANTED TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AS HAD BEEN PROMISED
WELL MY LITTLE FOAL YOU ARE A FINE FELLOW SAID THE YOUTH
I MAY NOT LET ANYONE IN THE SEVEN DWARFS HAVE FORBIDDEN ME TO DO SO ARE YOU AFRAID OF BEING POISONED ASKED THE OLD WOMAN
WHEN HE GOT THERE THE KING WAS STANDING OUTSIDE IN THE COURTYARD
THE PRINCE FOUND THAT IT PROCEEDED FROM AN IMMENSE GLOWING CARBUNCLE MADE INTO A BOX WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM
TOWARDS EVENING THE GOOD MAN'S DAUGHTER THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO GO HOME
AS THE PROCESSION WAS SO LONG IT ADVANCED BUT SLOWLY AND THE NURSE'S DAUGHTER SAT UP IN HER CARRIAGE TRYING TO LOOK LIKE A QUEEN
THE DUCHESS WAS GREATLY ELATED AND AS SHE SAT THERE IN STATE WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED TO CHANGE PLACES EVEN WITH GRACIOSA
THEN THE QUEEN SENT FOR THE FAIRY ONCE MORE AND SCOLDED HER UNTIL SHE WAS FAIRLY TERRIFIED AND PROMISED TO GO HOME AND THINK OF ANOTHER TASK FOR GRACIOSA WORSE THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS
THUS DRESSED HE PRESENTED HIMSELF THAT EVENING BEFORE THE DUKE OF BELOEIL AND OBTAINED LEAVE TO TRY AND DISCOVER HIS DAUGHTERS SECRET
NO WOODEN SHOES HAVE EVER BEEN OVER THAT FLOOR YET THEN GRACIOSA BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HER A WRITTEN MESSAGE TELLING THE QUEEN THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
NOW WHEN THIS WICKED KING HEARD OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE JOLLY KING HE WAS SO JEALOUS THAT HE COLLECTED A GREAT ARMY AND SET OUT TO FIGHT HIM AND THE NEWS OF HIS APPROACH WAS SOON BROUGHT TO THE KING AND QUEEN
AND NOW ALL THE PRINCESSES CAME TO THE CASTLE AND WERE TOGETHER AGAIN AND THEY WERE HAPPIER THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN IN THEIR LIVES
IS THERE NO MEANS OF SETTING THEM FREE NO SAID THE OLD WOMAN THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND THAT IS SO DIFFICULT THAT YOU WON'T FREE THEM BY IT FOR YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE DUMB AND NOT LAUGH FOR SEVEN YEARS AND IF YOU SPOKE A SINGLE WORD THOUGH BUT AN HOUR WERE WANTING TO THE TIME YOUR SILENCE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN IN VAIN AND THAT ONE WORD WOULD SLAY YOUR BROTHERS THEN THE GIRL SAID TO HERSELF
WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THAT HE WAS NOT LONG IN GETTING DOWN FROM THE TREE AND FLINGING THE BRIDLE OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD AND THEN HE BECAME SO TAME THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LED BY A THIN STRING
I THINK YOU MUST BE CRAZY SAID THE MAN FOR YOU CAN'T BE IN YOUR SENSES IF YOU THINK OF ANYTHING SO FOOLISH YOU MUST GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND BEG FOR HIS DAUGHTER--THERE IS NO HELP SAID THE YOUTH
BUT HE WOULD NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND PRETENDED TO BE DEAF AND DUMB
AH PRINCESS HE SAID BUT FOR THE WICKED QUEEN I FEAR YOU WOULD NEVER THINK OF ME AT ALL INDEED I SHOULD SAID GRACIOSA
AH MY DEAR MOTHER SAID HE GIVE ME SOME OF MY BROTHERS OLD CLOTHES AND FOOD ENOUGH FOR A FEW DAYS AND I WILL GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND SEEK MY FORTUNE FOR SO FAR AS I CAN SEE YOU HAVE CHILDREN ENOUGH HEAVEN HELP THEE MY SON SAID THE MOTHER THAT WILL NEVER DO
THEN THOU CANST TELL ME WHAT MY SEVEN FOALS EAT AND DRINK ASKED THE KING
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST AS THE PRINCE BEGAN CHASING IT FOR THE FOURTH TIME THE BEAST FLED TO A GREAT WHITE STONE TILTED IT UP AND ESCAPED INTO THE OTHER WORLD CRYING OUT TO THE PRINCE
SHE PUT ON HER ROSETTE'S PRETTIEST FROCK AND COVERED HER WITH DIAMONDS FROM HEAD TO FOOT
DEAR PRINCE DO NOT ROB ME OF MY SILVER AND MY GOLD THEREUPON THE KING'S SON RECOGNISED THE CINDER WENCH
IT WAS A SCENE OF WOE
DIG A GRAVE AND BURY THE GIANT AND THEN GO AND KILL THE GIANTESS BUT SAID JACK I COULD NOT KILL ANYONE UNLESS I WERE FIGHTING WITH HIM
SNOWDROP ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER WHEN THE SNOW-FLAKES WERE FALLING LIKE FEATHERS ON THE EARTH A QUEEN SAT AT A WINDOW FRAMED IN BLACK EBONY AND SEWED
INDEED IT IS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
I MADE HASTE ENOUGH TO GET IT AWAY AGAIN BUT IT MUST BE THAT WHICH SMELLS SO NOTWITHSTANDING YES IT MUST BE THAT SAID THE TROLL
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE SHE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY COLD AND TURNED ROUND SO OFTEN THAT SHE WOKE FRISK WHO STARTED UP AND HAVING A VERY GOOD NOSE SMELT THE SOLES AND HERRINGS SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT HE BEGAN TO BARK
DON'T GIVE THEM TO HER
THEN SALUTES WERE FIRED THE FLEET WEIGHED ANCHOR AND VERY SOON THEY REACHED THE PORT
COULDN'T YOU PLAY OFF A REALLY GOOD TRICK ON THE PRIEST
GOOD-BYE I AM GOING AWAY
IN THE MEANTIME THE YOUTH WENT AWAY WITH THE THIRD OX
A SHORT TIME SINCE THERE WAS A MAN HERE WHO SAID HE COULD DO IT SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER
THEN HOW IS IT THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE AH PRINCESS SAID HE I HAVE NEVER BEFORE DARED TO PRESENT MYSELF TO YOU BUT NOW THE KING'S MARRIAGE THREATENS YOU WITH SO MANY DANGERS THAT I HAVE RESOLVED TO TELL YOU AT ONCE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU ALREADY AND I TRUST THAT IN TIME I MAY WIN YOUR REGARD
THIS HE WAS DELIGHTED TO DO AND HAVING FIRST FETCHED FROM HIS OWN GARDEN ALL THE STRAWBERRIES CHERRIES NUTS AND FLOWERS HE COULD FIND
THEN HE WENT ALL DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY TO THE BEDSIDE OF TUBBY AND FOUND HIM SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE
VERY SOON RAPUNZEL FORGOT HER FEAR AND WHEN HE ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM SHE CONSENTED AT ONCE
WHAT GOOD WAS IT THAT I SENT HER MORE THAN FIFTY POUNDS OF SWEETMEATS AND AS MUCH AGAIN OF THE BEST SUGAR NOT TO MENTION TWO WESTPHALIA HAMS
IF YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO STEAL THE HORSES FROM UNDER THEM I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU WHAT YOU SET ME TO DO CAN BE DONE SAID THE MASTER THIEF BUT AM I CERTAIN TO GET YOUR DAUGHTER WHEN IT IS YES
AT LAST SHE DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS HOMESICK SO SHE WENT TO MOTHER HOLLE AND SAID
HERE SHE FOUND EVERYTHING IN PERFECT ORDER
AT THAT SAME MOMENT HALVOR ENTERED AND THE GIRLS WERE SO ASTONISHED THAT THEY LEFT THEIR KIRTLES LYING IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER AND RAN AWAY IN NOTHING BUT THEIR PETTICOATS
HOW CAN I WISH MY LITTLE DAUGHTER TO GROW UP PRETTY IF SHE IS TO BE MARRIED TO THAT HORRID LITTLE DWARF THE KING'S SON SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND YET IF SHE IS UGLY WE SHALL BOTH BE KILLED
SNOWDROP SHALL DIE SHE CRIED
THEY ARE PINK AND WHITE HE REPLIED AND THEIR EYES ARE BLUE DO YOU LIKE BLUE EYES SAID THE PRINCESS
SO THEY USED TO CALL HER TITTY
AND HE GUIDED BY THE SAME MADE A LEAP AT ME WHICH I HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO OBSERVE AND FORTUNATELY ESCAPED THE DANGER
BEWARE OF YOUR STEP-MOTHER
BUT NEXT YEAR WHEN HE RETURNED TO LOOK AFTER THE DAPPLED COLT AND THE MARES HE WAS QUITE APPALLED
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING YES
AND THEN HE TOLD HER HIS OWN HISTORY
THE DOOR STOOD OPEN
FROM THIS HOUR SHE HATED POOR SNOWDROP LIKE POISON AND EVERY DAY HER ENVY HATRED AND MALICE GREW FOR ENVY AND JEALOUSY ARE LIKE EVIL WEEDS WHICH SPRING UP AND CHOKE THE HEART
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ASKED THE MOTHER
SHE STRUCK THE HEARTH WITH THE BIRCHEN BRANCH AND LO
THE THINGS WOULD FIT NO ONE HOWEVER
WHEN SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO TELL HER MOTHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HER IN THE WOOD A TOAD JUMPED OUT SO THAT EVERYONE WAS QUITE DISGUSTED WITH HER
FIRE SHRIEKED THE TROLL
BUT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING HE COULD SAY THE PRINCESS WAS QUITE DETERMINED TO GO BACK THOUGH HE AT LAST PERSUADED HER TO STAY EIGHT DAYS WHICH WERE SO FULL OF PLEASURE AND AMUSEMENT THAT THEY PASSED LIKE A FEW HOURS
HAVING THANKED THE OLD WOMAN WITH TEARS IN HER EYES FOR HER HOSPITALITY AND FOR THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD GIVEN HER THE PRINCESS SET OUT ON HER JOURNEY AND RESTED NEITHER NIGHT NOR DAY SO GREAT WAS HER LONGING TO SEE HER HUSBAND AGAIN
PRINCE IVAN HAS COME AND CARRIED OFF MARYA MOREVNA IS IT POSSIBLE TO CATCH THEM IT IS POSSIBLE TO SOW WHEAT TO WAIT TILL IT GROWS UP TO REAP IT AND THRESH IT TO GRIND IT TO FLOUR TO MAKE FIVE PIES OF IT TO EAT THOSE PIES AND THEN TO START IN PURSUIT--AND EVEN THEN TO BE IN TIME KOSHCHEI GALLOPED OFF AND CAUGHT UP PRINCE IVAN
THE KING'S DAUGHTER WISHED TO SPARE HIM AND SAID THAT SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND LIGHT OF FOOT THAT SHE WOULD WILLINGLY WALK BUT HE WOULD NOT GIVE HER LEAVE TO DO THAT AND SHE WAS FORCED TO SEAT HERSELF ON HIS BACK AGAIN
SHE THANKED MINNIKIN AND EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT AGAIN AT ONCE
AT LAST HE JUMPED UP AND CAUGHT THE RAZOR OUT OF THE BARBER'S HAND EXCLAIMING
MY BRAVE FELLOWS SAYS THE BLACK THIEF YOU LITTLE KNOW THE DANGER YOU RUN
SHE WAS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED FOR SHE GUESSED THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER HUSBAND
BOUGHT A SHABBY OLD CART AND A GREAT CASK AND THEN HE TOLD A POOR OLD BEGGAR WOMAN THAT HE WOULD GIVE HER TEN DOLLARS IF SHE WOULD GET INTO THE CASK AND KEEP HER MOUTH WIDE-OPEN BENEATH THE TAP-HOLE INTO WHICH HE WAS GOING TO STICK HIS FINGER
THE PRINCESS MAYBLOSSOM ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHOSE CHILDREN HAD ALL DIED FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER UNTIL AT LAST ONLY ONE LITTLE DAUGHTER REMAINED AND THE QUEEN WAS AT HER WITS END TO KNOW WHERE TO FIND A REALLY GOOD NURSE WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER AND BRING HER UP
HALF MY KINGDOM IS THINE ALREADY SAID THE KING AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL BE THINE AFTER MY DEATH FOR MY SONS CAN GET COUNTRIES AND KINGDOMS FOR THEMSELVES NOW THAT THEY HAVE BECOME PRINCES AGAIN THEREFORE AS ALL MAY WELL BELIEVE THERE WAS JOY AND MERRIMENT AT THAT WEDDING.(31 31 FROM J
WE WANT TO GO DOWN TO YOUR PARENTS THEY SAID TO HALVOR SO WE WILL GO OUT AND LOOK ABOUT US HE FOLLOWED THEM OUT AND THEY CAME TO A LARGE POND OUTSIDE THE FARM-HOUSE
IN SPITE OF THIS HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE KING NOTICED THAT HIS THIRD DAUGHTER WAS GETTING VERY THIN AND SAD-LOOKING
GO AND TELL YOUR FATHER THAT I WILL MARRY HIM AND THEN YOU SHALL WASH IN MILK AND DRINK WINE BUT MY OWN DAUGHTER SHALL WASH IN WATER AND DRINK IT TOO THE GIRL WENT STRAIGHT HOME AND TOLD HER FATHER WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID
OUT OF IT FLEW ANOTHER CANARY AND SHE TOO BEGAN TO CRY
IF WE RETURN WITHOUT THE STEED WE WILL LOSE OUR HEADS SO I SEE WE ARE ILL FIXED ON BOTH SIDES WELL SAYS THE THIEF OF SLOAN IF IT WERE MY CASE I WOULD RATHER DIE BY THE KNIGHT THAN BY THE WICKED QUEEN
TO-MORROW WE WILL HUNT AGAIN SAID THE KING
YOU SEE YOUR BELOVED THERE
YOUR WIFE IS VERY ILL YOU MUST LET HER REST ALL TO-DAY THE KING SUSPECTED NO EVIL AND DIDN'T COME AGAIN TILL NEXT MORNING
ON THE SECOND MORNING WATER TO WASH IN AND WATER TO DRINK WAS STANDING FOR THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AS WELL
THERE SIT DOWN AND MAKE A GOOD BREAKFAST AND SHE PLACED A HUGE DISH BEFORE HIM OF SAVOURY STEAMING MEAT WHICH GREATLY PLEASED HIM AND MADE HIM FORGET HIS IDEA OF AN ENGLISHMAN BEING IN THE CASTLE
NO I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS ANYTHING BUT WITCHCRAFT
BUT I AM SORRY MYSELF THAT THIS YOUNG PRINCE HAS TO SUFFER FOR ALL
YES SAID THE KING I HAD ANOTHER DAUGHTER BUT THE TROLL CARRIED HER AWAY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD DELIVER HER
BUT COME TO THE CASTLE AND I WILL MAKE YOU LADY'S MAID TO THE COUNTESS I CANNOT DO THAT MY LORD
FLORIMOND SHE SIGHED IS THIS THE END OF YOUR GIFT
IT'S NO USE TO THINK OF CATCHING A HARE WHEN IT'S RUNNING AWAY IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE YOUTH LET ANOTHER HARE OUT AND THE PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN SAW THIS TOO AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE SAME
SHE HOWEVER DID NOT TROUBLE HERSELF IN THE LEAST ABOUT THE TAR BUT SET HER FOOT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND JUMPED OVER IT AND THUS ONE OF HER GOLD SHOES WAS LEFT STICKING IN IT
ON AND ON AND ON SHE WENT ACROSS BARE SANDY DESERTS WHERE THE ROADS WERE SO HEAVY THAT FOR EVERY TWO STEPS THAT SHE TOOK FORWARDS SHE FELL BACK ONE
SO AS THEY WALKED BACK OVER THE CLIFFS HE GAVE THE PRINCESS A GREAT PUSH HOPING SHE WOULD FALL INTO THE SEA
THE PRINCESS WEPT AND ENTREATED HIM TO STAY BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
THEY HAD THREE SONS TWO OF THEM WITH THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM BUT THE THIRD A SIMPLETON
HE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO THROW YOUR CASKET OUT INTO THE SEA ANSWERED THE STEP-MOTHER
THEN THE ELDEST PRINCESS CLAPPED HER HANDS THREE TIMES AND A TRAP DOOR OPENED
THE WITCH MADE PEASE-SOUP OF IT AND SET IT BEFORE THE DAUGHTER
ON THE FOURTH SHE HEARD A RUSTLING AMONG THE DIAMOND-SPANGLED LEAVES OF THE WOOD
WHEN THE MAN RETURNED AND FOUND THAT HE HAD LOST THAT TOO HE FELL INTO SUCH A RAGE THAT THERE WAS NO BOUNDS TO IT
GET DOWN AT ONCE MY POOR CHILD AND LET ME DRESS YOUR HAIR FOR YOU THE INNOCENT ZIZI CAME DOWN AT ONCE AND STOOD BY TITTY
AND QUICKLY TWO FOOTMEN RAN TO FETCH DRAKESTAIL
BUT THE KEYHOLE WAS SO LARGE THAT IT AD-MITTED PLENTY OF AIR AND HE COULD SEE EVERYTHING THAT TOOK PLACE THROUGH IT
HE WENT UP TO A TREE IN ORDER TO TAKE SHELTER UNDER IT AND ON THAT TREE HE SAW SOME YOUNG BIRDS WHICH WERE BEING THOROUGHLY DRENCHED
C
C
C
C
WITHOUT THAT LAST STEP THE WHOLE LADDER WAS USELESS
IT WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY MADE OF PURE GOLD AND DIAMONDS AND SHE ALSO GOT A NOBLE HORSE WITH HOUSINGS EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD AND A GOLDEN BRIDLE
BUT WHEN SHE SAW GRACIOSA'S SHE CRIED ANGRILY
WHY WHERE IS YOUR REVERENCE GOING SO FAST CRIED HE
LAY HE REPEATED THE THIRD TIME
GRACIOSA AND PERCINET ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD ONE CHARMING DAUGHTER
BESIDES I WILL GO WITH YOU MYSELF AND SHOW YOU THE ROAD AND WHATEVER FORTUNE YOU WILL HAVE I WILL TAKE CHANCE OF THE SAME THEY RETURNED HIM SINCERE THANKS FOR HIS KINDNESS AND HE BEING WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ROAD IN A SHORT TIME BROUGHT THEM WITHIN VIEW OF THE KNIGHT'S CASTLE
THEN HE SET TWO MEN TO HOLD HIM
AT LAST IT WAS DECIDED THAT MICHAEL SHOULD BE PUT TO THE TEST
PRESENTLY A STORM AROSE
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I'LL NOT GO OUT TO-NIGHT IN SUCH WEATHER AS THIS WELL THEN IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOURSELF SAID THE OLD WOMAN
BUT WHILE THEY WERE RUNNING DOWN FROM THE KING'S PALACE MINNIKIN HAD GOT OUT OF THE SHIP AND HAD PUT IT IN HIS POCKET AGAIN
AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS MINNIKIN DID THIS AND ALMOST BEFORE HE HAD CREPT INTO THE CUPBOARD AND HIDDEN HIMSELF CAME THE TROLL
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET ME SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER
YOU SEE MY CHILD HOW WISE YOU WERE IN DOING WHAT I TOLD YOU AND AS THE KING WAS OLD AND HAD NO HEIRS HE PUT THEM ON THE THRONE IN HIS PLACE
AT LAST HIS PHYSICIANS FEARING THAT HE WOULD FALL ILL ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD GO OUT AND AMUSE HIMSELF
HAVE PITY UPON ME AND GIVE ME TO DRINK
ROSETTE AND FRISK WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH TO FIND THEMSELVES ONCE MORE ON DRY LAND AND THE PRINCESS THANKED THE OLD MAN HEARTILY
IF THAT IS ALL I AM QUITE SURE I CAN FREE MY BROTHERS SO SHE SEARCHED FOR A HIGH TREE AND WHEN SHE HAD FOUND ONE SHE CLIMBED UP IT AND SPUN ALL DAY LONG NEVER LAUGHING OR SPEAKING ONE WORD
THE STEPMOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER WERE ENVIOUS OF THE KING'S DAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO PRETTY BUT SO LONG AS THE KING WAS AT HOME THEY DARED DO HER NO HARM BECAUSE HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS SO GREAT
AFTER SCRATCHING AND SCRAPING ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT THEY PRESENTLY MADE A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PUSH A VERY SLENDER NEEDLE AND OUT OF THIS THE PRINCESS LOOKED AT THE DAYLIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME
HE WHO HAS SUCH PRECIOUS THINGS IN GOLD AND SILVER AND DIAMONDS SAID THE KING MUST BE THE ONE WHO KILLED THE TROLL FOR SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE HAD ANYWHERE ELSE SO RITTER RED WAS THROWN INTO THE SNAKE-PIT AND MINNIKIN WAS TO HAVE THE PRINCESS AND HALF THE KINGDOM
BUT THE GLADDEST OF ALL WAS THE KING FOR NOW HE HAD GOT HIS OTHER DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN
SO EVERYONE MUST SEE THAT THEY COULD NOT BE LONG ON THEIR WAY THITHER.(20 20 FROM J
THE TWELVE COUPLES EMBARKED IN THE BOATS WHICH CROSSED BACK MANY TIMES IN ORDER TO CARRY OVER THE OTHER PRINCES
SO SHE WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER THE RESULT
SHE GAVE UP PLAYING WITH HER SISTERS IN THE GARDEN CEASED TO GATHER FLOWERS TO PUT IN HER HAIR AND NEVER SANG WHEN THEY SAT TOGETHER AT THEIR SPINNING AND SEWING
LONG WENT HE ON WITHOUT GETTING ANYTHING EITHER TO EAT OR TO DRINK
THE KING AND HIS HUNTSMEN SOON SAW THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE AND STARTED IN PURSUIT BUT THEY COULD NOT COME UP WITH IT AND WHENEVER THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SURE TO CATCH IT IT BOUNDED OFF TO ONE SIDE INTO THE BUSHES AND DISAPPEARED
ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS STANDING THUS BEHIND A TREE HE SAW THE OLD WITCH APPROACH AND HEARD HER CALL OUT
THEN LAY HOLD OF THE SWORD WHICH IS HANGING BY THE SIDE OF THE FLASK AND SMITE THE TROLL DEAD SO HE DID WHAT THE PRINCESS HAD TOLD HIM
ZIZI OBTAINED TITTY'S PARDON AND SHE WAS SENT BACK TO THE BRICK-FIELDS FOLLOWED AND HOOTED AT BY ALL THE BOYS
WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED FOR SOME TIME THEY HAD TO CROSS THE SEA AND THE BROTHER SAT DOWN AT THE HELM AND THE MOTHER AND THE TWO HALF-SISTERS WENT TO THE FORE-PART OF THE VESSEL AND THEY SAILED A LONG LONG WAY
HERE THE MUSICIAN HALTED BENT A STOUT HAZEL BOUGH DOWN TO THE GROUND FROM ONE SIDE OF THE PATH AND PUT HIS FOOT ON THE END OF IT TO KEEP IT DOWN
I AM GOING TO LOOK FOR MY WIFE THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA HARD WILL IT BE FOR YOU TO FIND HER REPLIED THE RAVEN
THEN HE RODE OUT AGAIN AND HE AND GUNNAR CHANGED SHAPES AND EACH WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND THEY WENT HOME TO THE WITCH QUEEN'S AND SIGURD GAVE THE DWARF'S RING TO HIS WIFE GUDRUN
SUDDENLY THE SKY WAS COVERED BY A BLACK CLOUD
SIRE I HAVE BEEN SEEKING HER THESE TWO HOURS BUT SHE IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND THIS WAS MORE THAN THE QUEEN COULD BEAR
WHEN HE GOT UP THERE AND FOUND THEM EACH MARE HAD HER FOAL AND BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THEM WAS A BIG DAPPLE-GREY FOAL AS WELL WHICH WAS SO SLEEK THAT IT SHONE AGAIN
MAY THERE GROW A GOLDEN HEMLOCK OUT OF MY BODY
THEY TOOK AWAY ALL HER JEWELS AND HER PRETTY DRESS AND GAVE HER A ROUGH COTTON FROCK WOODEN SHOES AND A LITTLE CLOTH CAP
SHE WOVE AND CUT IT OUT AT ONCE HOPING THAT THE COUNT WOULD NOT FORCE HER TO BEGIN THE OTHER
SHE SAID THAT SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM BUT THAT SHE RULED OVER ALL THE FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS AND SOME OF THEM MIGHT KNOW HIM
HOP
HOP
ALL THE STREETS WERE SPREAD WITH CARPETS AND THE WINDOWS WERE FULL OF LADIES WHO WERE WAITING TO SEE THE PRINCESS AND CARRIED BASKETS OF FLOWERS AND SWEETMEATS TO SHOWER UPON HER AS SHE PASSED
ROSETTE WAS BUSY AT HER EMBROIDERY BUT WHEN SHE SAW HER BROTHERS SHE GOT UP AND TAKING THE KING'S HAND CRIED
THIS TIME RENELDE WAS SPINNING NOT HEMP BUT FLAX
CANST THOU TELL ME THE WAY TO SORIA MORIA CASTLE
AFTER A LONG LONG TIME HE CAME TO THE ROAD ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING WHEN HE CAME TO THE ROBBERS
THE WOMAN THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO GO OUT TO SERVICE AND TOLD HER HUSBAND THAT HE WAS TO TAKE HIM SOMEWHERE
IF YOU WILL INDEED BE MY FRIEND I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID OF THAT WICKED OLD DUCHESS ANY MORE SO THEY WENT BACK TO THE PALACE TOGETHER AND THERE GRACIOSA FOUND A BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHICH PERCINET HAD BROUGHT FOR HER TO RIDE
AFTER KILLING THE BEAST THE PRINCE WENT BACK AGAIN PICKING UP ALL THE THREE SISTERS BY THE WAY WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THEM OUT INTO THE UPPER WORLD
THAT HORRID LITTLE ANIMAL AND HIS MISTRESS ARE DRINKING OUR HEALTH IN SEA-WATER NOW
AS KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS WAS RETURNING HOME HIS GOOD STEED STUMBLED BENEATH HIM
THE NURSE WHO KEPT THE PRINCESS INFORMED OF EVERYTHING THAT WENT FORWARD IN THE TOWN DID NOT FAIL TO REPEAT THE NEWS THAT SO NEARLY CONCERNED HER AND GAVE SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF THE SPLENDOUR IN WHICH THE AMBASSADOR FANFARONADE WOULD ENTER THE TOWN THAT THE PRINCESS WAS WILD TO SEE THE PROCESSION FOR HERSELF
BUT THE MAN TOOK OUT HIS ROLL OF TOBACCO LIGHTED A LITTLE OF IT AND THEN GAVE HER A WHIFF
BUT THAT WAS NO GOOD FOR THE LITTLE MOUSE ONLY SET TO WORK AND GNAWED AWAY AT THE SECOND EAR UNTIL IT HURT MORE THAN THE FIRST ONE
WHEN HE BROUGHT THEM HOME TO HIS MOTHER INSTEAD OF THE MONEY SHE EXPECTED FOR HER NICE COW SHE WAS VERY VEXED AND SHED MANY TEARS SCOLDING JACK FOR HIS FOLLY
AND STILL THE SPINNER SPUN
AT LAST SHE THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS TOO GOOD FOR HER AND SET HER TO WORK TO LOOK AFTER THE CATTLE
THE PRINCESS CRIED AND CRIED UNTIL EVEN THE FISHES WERE SORRY FOR HER
YOU POOR THING THERE YOU ARE TO BE SURE
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ASKED ABOUT FARMER WEATHERBEARD
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ASKED ABOUT FARMER WEATHERBEARD
BUT HOW STRANGE OF HIM WHEN I SHOULD HAVE LOVED HIM SO MUCH AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY TOGETHER AND THEN SHE CRIED HARDER THAN EVER FOR SHE COULD NOT HELP STILL LOVING HIM
BUT A VOICE IN HIS EAR SAID THIS HAND BELONGED TO ONE WHOM YOU CAN HELP AND RESTORE
I CAN'T GET NEAR BECAUSE OF MY NOSE SAID THE DAUGHTER
FIND OUT FROM KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS WHENCE HE GOT SO GOOD A STEED SO MARYA MOREVNA CHOSE A FAVOURABLE MOMENT AND BEGAN ASKING KOSHCHEI ABOUT IT
WHAT DOES HE WANT FINALLY THEY RUSHED AT HIM ALL TOGETHER TO OVERWHELM HIM WITH PECKS
SHE CERTAINLY WAS NOT WORTH BRINGING FROM THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD BUT SHE WENT ON ORDERING THEM ALL ABOUT AND FOR NO FAULT AT ALL WOULD GIVE SLAPS AND PINCHES TO EVERYONE SHE COULD REACH
THEN HE DRESSED HIMSELF IN RAGS DYED HIMSELF WITH SOOT AND PUT ON A WIG AND A GREAT BEARD OF GOAT'S HAIR SO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOGNISE HIM AND WENT TO THE PARADE GROUND WHERE THE GOVERNOR HAD ALREADY BEEN RIDING ABOUT A LONG TIME
IF SHE IS SO FOOLISH AS TO WISH TO DIE I CAN'T HELP IT
THE NEXT NIGHT EVERYTHING HAPPENED IN THE SAME WAY BUT THE TROLL WHO CAME THEN HAD SIX HEADS AND SIX RODS AND HE BEAT HIM MUCH MORE SEVERELY THAN THE FIRST HAD DONE BUT WHEN THE LAD WENT OUT OF DOORS NEXT MORNING THE PRINCESSES WERE OUT OF THE EARTH AS FAR AS THEIR KNEES
LA TRADITION
THEN THE NURSE DRESSED HER IN A ROBE OF PALE GREEN AND GOLD BROCADE AND COMBED OUT HER LONG FAIR HAIR TILL IT FLOATED ROUND HER LIKE A GOLDEN MANTLE AND PUT ON HER HEAD A CROWN OF ROSES AND JASMINE WITH EMERALD LEAVES
EVERYTHING WAS VERY SMALL IN THE LITTLE HOUSE BUT CLEANER AND NEATER THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE
WHOEVER WANTS A BEAUTIFUL DOLL SWEETMEATS OF ALL KINDS A LITTLE PAIR OF SCISSORS A GOLDEN ROBE AND A SATIN CAP HAS ONLY TO SAY WHERE FANFARONADE HAS HIDDEN THE PRINCESS MAYBLOSSOM BUT THE ANSWER EVERYWHERE WAS YOU MUST GO FARTHER WE HAVE NOT SEEN THEM HOWEVER THOSE WHO WENT BY SEA WERE MORE FORTUNATE FOR AFTER SAILING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME THEY NOTICED A LIGHT BEFORE THEM WHICH BURNED AT NIGHT LIKE A GREAT FIRE
THEN SAID THE LADY IN THE RED CAP YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO SLAY GIANTS
OH PERCINET
OH PERCINET
OH PERCINET
KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS WAS RETURNING HOME WHEN HIS HORSE STUMBLED BENEATH HIM
SHE DID NOT TAKE TIME TO PULL IT OFF BUT HASTILY UNFASTENING HER HORSE FROM THE PILLAR SHE RODE AWAY BEYOND THE CASTLE WALLS AS SWIFT AS AN ARROW
BUT IN THE EVENING HE IS BOTH SAD AND ANGRY FOR HE STANDS AT THE GATES OF DEATH
THIS TIME IT WAS THE PRINCE WHO COMPLAINED THAT THE BOAT SEEMED VERY HEAVY
AND SOMETIMES HE LOOKED AT THE TAR BUT AT LAST THE FLAMES BEGAN TO RISE FOR WHERESOEVER THE STRANGE HORSE BIT OR WHERESOEVER HE KICKED HE HIT UPON THE SPIKES IN THE HIDES AND AT LENGTH HE HAD TO YIELD
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SEE MARYA MOREVNA ANY MORE THAN YOUR OWN EARS AND HE TOOK HER AWAY AND CARRIED HER OFF HOME WITH HIM
BEFORE HER DEPARTURE FOR FAIRYLAND THE FAIRY EXPLAINED TO JACK THAT SHE HAD SENT THE BUTCHER TO MEET HIM WITH THE BEANS IN ORDER TO TRY WHAT SORT OF LAD HE WAS
THE NEXT THING TO DO WAS TO FIND THE CABINET AND THE PRINCE SOON CAME TO IT HIDDEN AWAY IN A DARK CORNER THOUGH INDEED IT WAS SO OLD AND BATTERED-LOOKING THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE NOTICED IT OF HIS OWN ACCORD
NEVER WAS GREATER MOURNING SEEN THAN WAS THROUGHOUT THE COURT AND THE WHOLE KINGDOM
WHEN THE WICKED QUEEN CAME AT SUNSET SHE WAS AMAZED AND INFURIATED TO FIND THE TASK DONE
TIS YOU
CHANGE THYSELF INTO A GOLD RING AND SET THYSELF ON MY FINGER SAID THE PRINCESS
SO SHE DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD STARVE HERSELF TO DEATH IF THEY DID NOT FIND SOME MEANS OF LETTING HER SEE FANFARONADE'S GRAND ENTRY INTO THE TOWN
DOST THOU SCENT ANY ILL PRINCE IVAN HAS COME AND CARRIED OFF MARYA MOREVNA CAN WE CATCH THEM GOD KNOWS
HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND TOOK HER IN FRONT OF HIM AND HOLDING HER CAREFULLY IN HIS ARMS THEY BEGAN THEIR JOURNEY
HE STUCK TO HIS OLD SPEECH IT IS BETTER THAT ONE LIFE SHOULD BE LOST THAN TWO THIS EVENING ALSO MINNIKIN BEGGED FOR LEAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE SEA-SHORE
BUT WHAT WAS MY TERROR WHEN I HEARD THE GIANT GROPING AMONG THE BODIES AND FANCYING MYSELF CUT THE HALF OF MY HIP OFF AND TOOK IT WITH HIM TO BE ROASTED
WHO'S BEEN USING MY LITTLE FORK THE SIXTH SAID
JACK WATCHED HIM THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND WAS AMAZED TO SEE HIM PICK A WOLF'S BONE AND PUT HALF A FOWL AT A TIME INTO HIS CAPACIOUS MOUTH
THEY ALL ASKED HOW SHE COULD WANT TO GO TO CHURCH WHEN SHE HAD NOTHING TO WEAR BUT THAT WOODEN GOWN WHICH WAS SO BLACK AND HIDEOUS
ARE YOU READY ASKED THE ELDEST
NOW WHEN THE GIRLS FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE THEY FELT SO SAD AND DULL THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
I'LL TAKE CARE THEY SHAN'T CATCH ME SISTER BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID THEY ARE CERTAIN TO KILL YOU AND THEN I SHALL BE LEFT ALL ALONE IN THE FOREST AND FORSAKEN BY EVERYONE
IF THOU CANST WATCH THEM FOR A WHOLE DAY AND TELL ME AT NIGHT WHAT THEY EAT AND DRINK THOU SHALT HAVE THE PRINCESS AND HALF MY KINGDOM BUT IF THOU CANST NOT I WILL CUT THREE RED STRIPES ON THY BACK THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
IT'S NOT THE LEAST USE FOR HER TO COME HERE FOR SHE HAS FEET LIKE A HORSE THAT MAY BE SAID THE PRINCE BUT AS ALL THE OTHERS HAVE TRIED IT KARI MAY TRY IT TOO KARI HE CALLED OUT THROUGH THE DOOR AND KARI CAME UPSTAIRS AND HER WOODEN GOWN CLATTERED AS IF A WHOLE REGIMENT OF DRAGOONS WERE COMING UP
NO SAID CINDERLAD
NO SAID CINDERLAD
WHILE IT WAS BROWNING AT THE FIRE TUBBY INQUIRED FOR HIS GOOSE A SECOND TIME
SHE DID THIS WITHOUT BEING TOLD
HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS OR WHITHER HE WAS GOING BUT HE NEVER LINGERED LONGER IN ANY PLACE THAN WAS ENOUGH TO LET HIS HORSE GET A LITTLE FOOD WHEN THEY CAME TO ONE OF THESE GREEN SPOTS WHILE HE HIMSELF TOOK OUT HIS BAG OF PROVISIONS
AND THE PRINCE AND HIS WIFE AND THE BABY LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTERWARDS.(9 9 FROM THE RUSSO-KARELIAN
STILL THE GIANT CAME ON SO FAST THAT HE WAS QUITE CLOSE TO POOR JACK AND HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS GREAT HAND TO CATCH HIM
THEY LIGHTED THEIR SEVEN LITTLE LAMPS AND AS SOON AS THEIR EYES GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THE GLARE THEY SAW THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN IN THE ROOM FOR ALL WAS NOT IN THE SAME ORDER AS THEY HAD LEFT IT
YOU SHALL HAVE THEM FOR THE HORSE AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET SOONER TO SORIA MORIA CASTLE HALVOR CONSENTED TO THIS AT ONCE AND THE OLD WOMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THE HORSE THAT SHE WAS READY TO DANCE
MICHAEL FLUNG THE CONTENTS OF THE CUP BEHIND HIM SPRANG OVER THE TABLE AND FELL AT LINA'S FEET
OH SAID THE COCKCHAFER WE ALL KNOW YOU VERY WELL SINCE WE SPEND TWO OR THREE MONTHS IN YOUR GARDEN EVERY YEAR THEREUPON THE KING AND THE PRINCE MADE GREAT FRIENDS WITH HIM AND THEY ALL WALKED ARM-IN-ARM AND DINED TOGETHER AND AFTERWARDS THE COCKCHAFER SHOWED THEM ALL THE CURIOSITIES OF HIS STRANGE COUNTRY WHERE THE TINIEST GREEN LEAF COSTS A GOLD PIECE AND MORE
THAT I WILL TELL YOU ANSWERED MINNIKIN
NOW BROTHERS WHO IS GOING TO LIFT THIS STONE NEITHER OF THEM COULD SO MUCH AS STIR IT BUT AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED IT AWAY IT FLEW TO A DISTANCE THOUGH IT WAS EVER SO BIG--BIG AS A HILL
AND ONE DAY OTTER HAD BEEN FISHING THERE AND HAD KILLED A SALMON AND EATEN IT AND WAS SLEEPING LIKE AN OTTER ON A STONE
WHEN THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE FOUND THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT OPENED TO THEM THEY TOOK CROWBARS AND FORCED THE PORTAL
HOWEVER WHEN HE WENT INTO HE GALLERY NEXT DAY AND LOOKED AT THE PAINTED WINDOWS AGAIN HE FOUND THAT THEY MOVED AND THE FIGURES CAME AND WENT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ALIVE AND AFTER WATCHING THE ONE WHO WAS LIKE HIMSELF FIND THE KEY IN THE CRACK OF THE TURRET WALL AND OPEN THE OLD CABINET HE DETERMINED TO GO AND EXAMINE THE PLACE HIMSELF AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE MYSTERY WAS
BUT AGAIN LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR HE EXCLAIMED
THEY WOULD NOT ALL HAVE TOLD ME TO TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF THESE BONES IF THEY HAD NOT HAD SOME GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO
THE KING'S SON CARRIED MY DAUGHTER ABOUT BUT THE POOR THING FELL AND BROKE HER ARM THE GIRL KNEW WELL HOW MATTERS REALLY STOOD BUT SHE PRETENDED TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND SAT DUMB BEHIND THE STOVE
SO HE GOT HER TO WIFE AND MINNIKIN THE YOUNGER SISTER
THE NEXT DAY THEY SEARCHED AGAIN BUT WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS
THEN HE LED HER TO HIS KINGDOM WHERE THEY WERE RECEIVED AND WELCOMED WITH GREAT JOY AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.(23 23 GRIMM
THIS WAS SOME HELP TO THEM BUT VERY SOON THEY WERE JUST AS COLD AS BEFORE
IT CAME TO PASS ONE NIGHT AS HE WAS GOING THROUGH A GREAT WOOD THAT A TERRIBLE STORM CAME ON
THEN THE WIDOW WOMAN SAID TO THE REINDEER
AND THE PRINCES WERE SO SURE THAT ROSETTE WAS FAR PRETTIER THAN HER PORTRAIT THAT THEY WENT WITHOUT A MURMUR
GO AND FETCH HER AND LET HER TRY ON THE THINGS SO THE GIRL WAS FETCHED AND THE PRINCE WAS JUST GOING TO HAND THE ORNAMENTS TO HER WHEN THE WITCH HELD HIM BACK SAYING
BUT PRAY SAVE A LITTLE FOR ME AS I AM DYING OF HUNGER AND THIRST BUT HE SEIZED THE PITCHER AND DRANK ALL IT CONTAINED AT A SINGLE DRAUGHT AND THEN BROKE IT TO ATOMS ON THE NEAREST STONE SAYING WITH A MALICIOUS SMILE
GRACIOSA BELONGS TO HER THE WICKED QUEEN WAITED IMPATIENTLY UNTIL NIGHT FELL AND THEN SHE ORDERED HER CARRIAGE TO BE BROUGHT
SO HE TOOK IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND FIRST HE PUT ONE FOOT INTO IT AND THEN THE OTHER AND NO SOONER HAD HE PUT ONE FOOT INTO THE SHIP THAN IT BECAME MUCH LARGER AND WHEN HE SET THE OTHER FOOT INTO IT IT GREW AS LARGE AS SHIPS THAT SAIL ON THE SEA
AT LENGTH I CAME TO AN OLD KILN AND BEING MUCH FATIGUED I WENT UP AND LAY ON THE RIBS
PERHAPS HE WON'T CATCH US SO THEY GOT READY AND FLED
OH I AM GOING ABOUT SEEKING A PLACE MY FATHER SAID THE YOUTH
GO YOUNG MAN FOLLOW YOUR DREAM AND IF YOU DO NOT FIND THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU SEEK AT ANY RATE YOU WILL HAVE HAD THE HAPPINESS OF SEEKING IT IV THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE AROSE EARLY AND TOOK LEAVE OF HIS HOST
I DID NOT THEN KNOW IN WHAT MANNER TO ACT FOR IF I WAS SEEN I WOULD SURELY LOSE MY LIFE AS EVERYBODY HAD A LOOK-OUT AT THAT TIME AND BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PERSON BOLD ENOUGH TO COME IN ON ME
HE FELT HIMSELF DISGRACED IN THE EYES OF HIS FATHER BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN DISOBEDIENT TO YOU
THEY ARE PRINCES AND PRINCESSES WHO HAVE HAPPENED TO OFFEND ME
HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER EMBRACED THEM BOTH AND THERE WAS FEASTING IN THE PALACE FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS
SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD BEEN WALKING BY THE RIVER AND HAD DROPPED ONE OF HER GREEN SATIN SLIPPERS INTO THE WATER
WHEN THE GIRL HAD DONE ALL THAT SHE HAD GROWN SO LOVELY THAT NO ONE ON EARTH COULD RIVAL HER
BAKER BAKER TAKE HIM BY HIS FEET AND THROW HIM INTO THE OVEN NO REPLIED THE BAKER
BUT THIS TIME SHE DID NOT DARE TO DISOBEY AND IN A VERY BAD TEMPER STOOPED DOWN OVER THE WELL
THEN DULLHEAD FELL TO AT ONCE TO HEW DOWN THE TREE AND WHEN IT FELL HE FOUND AMONGST ITS ROOTS A GOOSE WHOSE FEATHERS WERE ALL OF PURE GOLD
THEN HE WENT TO THE PART OF THE CASTLE WHICH WAS THE NURSERY AND ALSO KILLED ALL THE POOR LITTLE ONES HE FOUND THERE
IN THIS GUISE SHE WENT OVER THE SEVEN HILLS TILL SHE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN DWARFS
SOMETIMES SHE WOULD REST FOR A LITTLE ON A MOUNTAIN AND THEN START AFRESH ALWAYS FARTHER AND FARTHER ON
IT'S A PRETTY LITTLE REVENGE TO KEEP THEM LIKE THAT OH
SO MARRY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY I ASK NOTHING BETTER THAN TO MARRY REPLIED DESIRE BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN THAT PLEASES ME
WE WERE CLEVERER THAN CARABOSSE AFTER ALL
HERE SAID THE FAIRY IS A LITTLE TASK WHICH IT WILL TAKE ALL YOUR PRISONER'S SKILL AND PATIENCE TO ACCOMPLISH
ISN'T A GRASSHOPPER AS GOOD AS A CRICKET SAID SHE
MARELLES
MARELLES
ALL DAY LONG SHE SAT IN HER CHAIR NODDING HER HEAD AND NEVER SAYING A WORD
HE IS SO RICH AND HAS SO MUCH WEALTH OF ALL KINDS SAID THE MAN
HOWEVER WHAT SHE REALLY DID DO WAS TO HAVE A GREAT HOLE AS DEEP AS A WELL DUG IN HER GARDEN AND THE TOP OF IT COVERED WITH A FLAT STONE
WHAT NEWS CRIED THE QUEEN AND HE ANSWERED
ONE WAS BRIGHT AND GLITTERING AND DRAWN BY SWANS AND PEACOCKS WHILE THE FAIRY WHO SAT IN IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AS A SUNBEAM
KOSHCHEI HAPPENED TO BE AWAY FROM HOME AT THAT MOMENT
THE PRINCE LONGED TO SEE THE OWNER OF THE VOICE BUT HE SOUGHT IN VAIN FOR A DOOR IN THE TOWER
LISTEN GREAT AND SMALL
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HIS FATHER OFTEN SAID TO HIM
BLESS ME SAID SHE WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW
NOW YOU SHALL SEE ONE OF MINE SO HE GRASPED THE SWORD WHICH HE HAD GOT FROM THE OLD CROOK-BACKED WOMAN AND SLASHED AT THE TROLL SO THAT ALL FIVE HEADS WENT FLYING AWAY OVER THE SANDS
AND HE TOLD HER THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A SON AND THAT SON WOULD BE A GREAT WARRIOR AND WOULD AVENGE HIM ON THE OTHER KING HIS ENEMY
BELIEVE ME THE PRINCESS MAYBLOSSOM WAS FAR TOO WELL BROUGHT UP TO THINK OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH AN AMBASSADOR AT THIS THE NURSE CAME FORWARD AND FALLING ON HER KNEES CONFESSED HOW THEY HAD MADE THE LITTLE NEEDLE-HOLE IN THE TOWER AND HOW THE PRINCESS HAD DECLARED WHEN SHE SAW THE AMBASSADOR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY HIM AND NOBODY ELSE
HE FOUND THEM BOTH SITTING ON THE STAIRS WHILE BESIDE THEM THE BEER WAS RUNNING ALL OVER THE GROUND FROM THE TAP WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN
YES I WILL GLADLY GO WITH YOU ONLY HOW AM I TO GET DOWN OUT OF THE TOWER
HERE TOO SHE WAS HIDDEN AWAY SO THAT THE WIND MIGHT NOT NOTICE HER
AND WHEN THE WEDDING WAS OVER AND ALL THE FEAST THEN THE MAGIC OF THE WITCH'S WINE WENT OUT OF SIGURD'S BRAIN AND HE REMEMBERED ALL
I HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THEM HEAVEN ALONE KNOWS IN WHAT PART OF THE WIDE WORLD THEY ARE WANDERING REPLIED HER MOTHER
HE HAD A FANCY TO TRY TO WATCH THE SEVEN FOALS HIMSELF HE SAID
BUT THEN HE HIMSELF WAS SO WORN OUT AND WEAK THAT HE COULD NOT MOVE AT ALL
BUT FIRST OF ALL HE MUST GET HER QUITE AS GOOD A HORSE TO RIDE TO THE WEDDING ON AS THAT WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF
THAT STEPMOTHER OF OURS BEATS US REGULARLY EVERY DAY AND IF WE DARE GO NEAR HER SHE KICKS US AWAY
THE CHARM WAS BROKEN
AT LAST THEY WERE BOTH UTTERLY EXHAUSTED SO THEY LAY DOWN TO TAKE A SHORT REST
SO ONE BY ONE THE KNIGHTS CAME OUT AGAINST HIM AND ONE BY ONE HE VANQUISHED THEM ALL AND THEN HE OPENED THE BOX AND SAID THAT TO CONSOLE THEM HE WOULD SHOW THEM THE PORTRAIT OF HIS QUEEN OF BEAUTY AND WHEN HE DID SO EVERYONE RECOGNISED THE PRINCESS GRACIOSA
WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE SINGLE HAPPY HOUR SINCE OUR MOTHER DIED
SO THAT THERE MAY BE MEAT AND DRINK FOR ME ALL THIS THE PRINCE DID
HE THEN THREATENED THE PRINCESS UNTIL AT LENGTH SHE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE TO SAY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD RESCUED HER FOR HE TOLD HER THAT IF SHE DID NOT HE WOULD KILL HER
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW THAT SHE WAS DELIVERED SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND SKIPPED AND DANCED
WHAT ARE YOU COMING TO LOOK FOR HERE
NEXT MORNING WHEN THE GOOSE-GIRL CAME TO LET OUT THE GEESE SHE HEARD THE PRIEST BEMOANING HIMSELF AS HE LAY IN THE SACK IN THE GOOSE-HOUSE
FOR SHE WAS A WARRIOR MAID HERSELF AND WENT ARMED INTO THE BATTLE LIKE A MAN
I KNOW I AM A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER OFF HERE THAN I EVER WAS IN MY LIFE BEFORE BUT NOTWITHSTANDING I HAVE A GREAT LONGING TO GO HOME IN SPITE OF ALL YOUR KINDNESS TO ME
SO THAT'S IT SAYS HE
SHE SHALL HIDE HERSELF TWICE AND THEN THOU SHALT HIDE THYSELF TWICE
CARRY THIS BOX TO MY CASTLE AND PLACE IT UPON THE TABLE IN MY OWN ROOM
NOW THAT YOU ARE KING PLEASE TAKE ME OUT OF THIS DULL TOWER FOR I AM SO TIRED OF IT THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY BUT THE KING KISSED HER AND TOLD HER TO DRY HER TEARS AS THAT WAS JUST WHAT THEY HAD COME FOR TO TAKE HER OUT OF THE TOWER AND BRING HER TO THEIR BEAUTIFUL CASTLE AND THE PRINCE SHOWED HER THE POCKETFUL OF SUGAR PLUMS HE HAD BROUGHT FOR HER AND SAID
BUT THE PRINCE SPOKE TO HER SO KINDLY AND TOLD HER AT ONCE THAT HIS HEART HAD BEEN SO TOUCHED BY HER SINGING THAT HE FELT HE SHOULD KNOW NO PEACE OF MIND TILL HE HAD SEEN HER
THIS ANNOYED HER MAJESTY VERY MUCH AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO ORDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE ARRESTED WHEN THE WITCH--FOR SHE WAS A WITCH--WITH TWO BLOWS FROM A WAND SUMMONED A CHARIOT OF FIRE DRAWN BY WINGED DRAGONS AND WAS WHIRLED OFF THROUGH THE AIR UTTERING THREATS AND CRIES
SHE WEPT AND SHE WAILED BUT AS HER BROTHER HAD SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE MUST DO IT
WHEN SHE CAME IN SHE PUT HER SILENT WHEEL INTO A CORNER AND CRIED FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS
HE TOOK HIS GOURD AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS
AND AFTER FLYING SOME DISTANCE SHE BROUGHT HIM TO HIS JOURNEY'S END TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND FLEW AWAY BACK
ONE DAY THE MOTHER OF THE MOON ASKED HER
WHAT A LOVELY BIRD SAID TUBBY AND IN STROKING ITS HEAD HE TOUCHED A PIN THAT WAS STICKING BETWEEN ITS FEATHERS
IN LOOKING AT PICTURES OF MUSICIANS HE SAW THEIR HANDS MOVE AND HEARD SWEET SOUNDS
THE YOUNG MEN WERE REALLY THE PRINCES WHO TO THE NUMBER OF FIFTY AT LEAST HAD TRIED TO STEAL THE PRINCESSES SECRET
HO OLD MAN HALLOA
MOTHER HOLLE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WIDOW WHO HAD TWO DAUGHTERS
I SHALL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU ALL MY LIFE OLD DAME SAID THE PRINCESS IF YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MY HUSBAND
AND FIRST OF ALL THEY HAD A PORTRAIT MADE OF THE PRINCESS WHICH WAS SO LIKE HER THAT YOU REALLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF IT HAD SPOKEN TO YOU
JUST LOOK AT THAT HARE SAID THE PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN AND WANTED TO GO OUT AND CATCH IT
HOW COULD YOU LET HIM GO AWAY
JUST AS SHE HAD FINISHED SEWING IT BURCHARD THE WOLF PASSED BY
THE QUEEN WAS VERY MUCH VEXED BY THIS ACCIDENT BUT SHE SOON SELECTED ANOTHER WHO WAS JUST STEPPING FORWARD WHEN AN EAGLE FLEW BY AND DROPPED A LARGE TORTOISE UPON HER HEAD WHICH WAS CRACKED IN PIECES LIKE AN EGG-SHELL
THE PRINCESS'S NURSE WHO HAD NEVER LEFT HER SOMETIMES TOLD HER ABOUT THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE TOWER AND THOUGH THE PRINCESS HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING FOR HERSELF YET SHE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY THANKS TO THE SECOND FAIRY'S GIFT
YOUR CHILD AND PERHAPS YOURSELF WILL BE LEFT DESOLATE IN THE END AND WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE ME TO DO SAID SHE
HOW COULD I BE PLEASED TO MARRY AN UGLY LAME PRINCESS CERTAINLY IT IS BECOMING IN YOU TO OBJECT TO THAT SAID KING GRUMPY SINCE YOU ARE UGLY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANYONE YOURSELF THAT IS THE VERY REASON SAID THE PRINCE THAT I WISH TO MARRY SOMEONE WHO IS NOT UGLY
WELL THAT WILL NOT BE A VERY HARD THING TO DO THOUGHT THE YOUTH
HELP
HELP
I ASK NOTHING BETTER SAID THE BOATMAN
I SHALL GO AND LOOK FOR MARYA MOREVNA AND WHEN HE HAD FOUND HER HE SAID TO HER
THE WITCH SAID TO THE MAN
THE REST OF THE PRINCES FELL LIKEWISE AT THE KNEES OF THE PRINCESSES EACH OF WHOM CHOSE A HUSBAND AND RAISED HIM TO HER SIDE
HOWEVER I THINK I HAVE SETTLED HER PRETENSIONS AND I HOPE YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY AND ENJOY THE FREEDOM I HAVE WON FOR YOU THE PRINCESS THANKED HER HEARTILY AND THEN THE FAIRY DESPATCHED ONE OF HER PEACOCKS TO HER PALACE TO BRING A GORGEOUS ROBE FOR MAYBLOSSOM WHO CERTAINLY NEEDED IT FOR HER OWN WAS TORN TO SHREDS BY THE THORNS AND BRIARS
WELL SAID HE DID HER BROTHERS TELL ME TRULY
THE NURSE ASKED THE BOATMAN
IF YOU DO NOT PAY ME I WILL BE PAID BY YOUR HEIRS THEREUPON HE PULLED HIS HAT DOWN OVER HIS EYES WENT HASTILY OUT OF THE HALL AND LEFT THE TOWN WITHOUT SPEAKING TO A SOUL
THE YOUTH SAID THAT THE KING HAD NEVER TOLD HIM HE WAS TO DO THAT AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NOW REALLY EARNED THE PRINCESS
ABOUT MID-DAY HE REACHED A SANDY PLAIN SCORCHING IN THE SUN
BUT WHEN SHE WOKE UP AGAIN HER FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT DELIGHTFUL AS THIS FAIRY PALACE SEEMED TO HER YET SHE COULD NOT STAY IN IT BUT MUST GO BACK TO HER FATHER
IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN WHO IT WAS SHE SAID I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HER
WHO DRINKS OF ME WILL BE A TIGER
LET HIM BE ALIVE OR LET HIM BE DEAD I'LL GRIND HIS BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD YOU STUPID OLD GIANT SAID HIS WIFE YOU ONLY SMELL A NICE SHEEP WHICH I HAVE GRILLED FOR YOUR DINNER AND THE GIANT SAT DOWN AND HIS WIFE BROUGHT UP A WHOLE SHEEP FOR HIS DINNER
IF IT GOES ON LIKE THIS I SHALL BE STARVED BUT WHEN SHE GLANCED AT THE DISH AGAIN IT WAS COVERED WITH ALL SORTS OF NICE THINGS TO EAT AND THE QUEEN MADE A VERY GOOD DINNER AND WAS GAYER THAN USUAL OVER IT
HE TURNED A PAGE AND THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT SMELL OF A SAVOURY DINNER AND ONE OF THE FIGURES WHO SAT AT THE FEAST LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID
THEN HE RAN BACK TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD FOUND OUT WHERE ALL HIS DINNERS AND SUPPERS WENT
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME KARI WOULD NOT GIVE IN BUT WENT ON BEGGING FOR LEAVE TILL SHE GOT IT AND THEN SHE RAN UP THE STAIRS SO THAT HER WOODEN GOWN CLATTERED AGAIN
WE ARE VERY SORRY TO HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO TELL YOU THEN THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING THE QUEEN VERY SAD SO SAD THAT THE KING NOTICED IT AND ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
ALL THESE HE PILED ON THE BACK OF THE GOOD HORSE GRANI AND THEN HE RODE SOUTH TO HINDFELL
TO MY FATHER'S CASTLE HE SAID
SO SHE GATHERED THEM ALL TOGETHER BY BLOWING A WHISTLE WHICH SHE HAD AND QUESTIONED THEM BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM WHICH KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT FARMER WEATHERBEARD
SO SHE GATHERED THEM ALL TOGETHER BY BLOWING A WHISTLE WHICH SHE HAD AND QUESTIONED THEM BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM WHICH KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT FARMER WEATHERBEARD
AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN ON THE THIRD THURSDAY NIGHT THE KING ONCE MORE INSISTED ON KEEPING WATCH
LEMOINE
THE BIRD FLEW INTO THE KITCHEN
A HORSE-DEALER CAME WHO HAD A GREAT FANCY TO BARGAIN FOR THE HORSE AND THE MAN GOT A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT BUT WHEN THE BARGAIN WAS MADE AND JACK'S FATHER HAD GOT THE MONEY THE HORSE-DEALER WANTED TO HAVE THE HALTER
I MUST HAVE ENTIRE CONTROL OF YOUR DAUGHTER TO DO AS I PLEASE WITH HER OH CERTAINLY YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
THE STORY OF SIGURD THIS IS A VERY OLD STORY
WHY DID YE COME BACK HOW COULD WE HELP COMING BACK
A LITTLE DOG WAS WITH HER AND SHE SAID TO IT GO OUT LITTLE SNOW AND SEE IF IT WILL SOON BE DAY THIS SHE SAID THRICE AND THE THIRD TIME THAT SHE SENT OUT THE DOG TO SEE IT WAS VERY NEAR DAWN
I DON'T KNOW HOW I AM EVER TO QUENCH THIS TERRIBLE THIRST I AM SUFFERING FROM
THAT FARED WELL AND KING AND QUEEN LIVED HAPPY TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL YEARS
BUT THIS HAPPY STATE OF THINGS DID NOT LAST LONG
SHE HAD A LOW FOREHEAD A FLAT NOSE THICK LIPS COARSE HAIR AND A SKIN NOT GOLDEN LIKE THAT OF ZIZI BUT THE COLOUR OF CLAY
I KNOW BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO HAVE TO RISE AND LIGHT THE FIRES AND STILL I WAKEN AT THE SAME TIME A STRANGE QUEEN TO LIGHT THE FIRES THOUGHT THE KING
AND NOW SHE BECAME BRISK AND WELL AGAIN AND GREW SO ROSY AND PLUMP AND FAIR THAT THE QUEEN AND HER SCRAGGY DAUGHTER TURNED BLUE AND WHITE WITH VEXATION AT IT
ONLY YOU MUST NOT CALL ME UNTIL YOU ARE IN THE UTMOST NEED IN THAT CASE WE SHALL NOT SEE EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME SAID MINNIKIN
CLICK CLOCK CLACK OUR GOLDEN MAID'S COME BACK THEN SHE WENT IN TO HER STEPMOTHER AND AS SHE HAD RETURNED COVERED WITH GOLD SHE WAS WELCOMED HOME
FIRE SCREECHED THE TROLL
OH JUST TAKE A VERY LARGE BREAD-KNIFE SHARPEN IT AND PRETEND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO CUT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE THIRD OF THE FOUR LOAVES WHICH ARE LYING ON THE KITCHEN TABLE IN THE KING'S PALACE--COUNT THEM FROM RIGHT TO LEFT--AND YOU WILL SOON FIND HER SAID DAPPLEGRIM
ON MONDAY NIGHT THE MASTER THIEF ONCE MORE CAME AS AN ANGEL AND BEFORE THE PRIEST WAS PUT INTO THE SACK HE FELL ON HIS KNEES AND THANKED HIM
THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT KNOW HIM AGAIN AND DRAGGED HIM IN AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE TO HELP HER TO DO THE WORK
THAT IS WHERE WE SHALL LAND SAID THE BROTHER POINTING ACROSS THE SEA
BUT WHERE IS KARI WOODENGOWN THEN ASKED THE PRINCE WHEN ALL THE OTHERS HAD TRIED ON THE SHOE FOR HE UNDERSTOOD THE SONG OF BIRDS AND IT CAME TO HIS MIND WHAT THE BIRD HAD SAID
THERE STANDS AN OLD TREE
THE OLD DAME HAD SUCH LARGE TEETH THAT THE GIRL FELT FRIGHTENED AND WANTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE OLD WOMAN CALLED AFTER HER
AT LAST THEY BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES OF TELLING THE KING THAT THE YOUTH HAD SAID THAT IF HE CHOSE HE WAS QUITE ABLE TO RESCUE THE PRINCESS WHO HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF INTO THE MOUNTAIN A LONG TIME AGO BY THE TROLL
THE NEXT MORNING THE MOTHER OF THE WIND TOLD HER THAT HER HUSBAND WAS LIVING IN A THICK WOOD SO THICK THAT NO AXE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CUT A WAY THROUGH IT
THE FARMER BEGAN TO SCOLD HIM FURIOUSLY BUT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY I AM GOING AWAY MADE HIS CLOTHES INTO A BUNDLE SAID GOOD-BYE TO ALL HIS FRIENDS AND BOLDLY SET OUT TO SEEK HIS FORTUNES
WILL HE CONSENT TO OUR MARRIAGE NO LET HIM DIE THEN BUT WHAT WILL THE COUNTESS SAY THE COUNTESS WILL UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT
BUT HE HAS GIVEN ME ONE AND HE SHALL GO IN PEACE ROPE O ROPE CRIED THE VOICE AGAIN TWINE YOURSELF ROUND HIS NECK AND STRANGLE HIM NO REPLIED THE ROPE
SO THE MAID FOLLOWED HER INTO THE WOOD AND WATCHED AND SAW HOW THE STEP-DAUGHTER TOOK THE CLOTH OUT OF THE BLUE BULL'S EAR AND SPREAD IT OUT AND HOW THE CLOTH WAS THEN COVERED WITH THE MOST DELICATE DISHES WHICH THE STEP-DAUGHTER ATE AND REGALED HERSELF WITH
I ASSURE YOU I AM ROWING AS HARD AS I CAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE THE GARDEN BOY SAW A BEAUTIFUL CASTLE SPLENDIDLY ILLUMINATED WHENCE CAME THE LIVELY MUSIC OF FIDDLES KETTLE-DRUMS AND TRUMPETS
WHAT SAID THE PRINCESS DO THEY DARE TO KILL THAT BEAUTIFUL CREATURE AND EAT IT
AS THEY CAME BACK MICHAEL GATHERED A BRANCH FROM THE WOOD WITH THE GOLD-SPANGLED LEAVES AND NOW IT WAS THE ELDEST PRINCESS WHO HEARD THE NOISE THAT IT MADE IN BREAKING
SIT DOWN AND I WILL BRING IT UP AT ONCE THE GIANT SAT DOWN AND SOON HIS WIFE BROUGHT UP A ROASTED BULLOCK ON A LARGE DISH AND THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER
AHA I WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID THE MUSICIAN
AT NIGHT WHEN HE IS ASLEEP YOU MUST GET UP VERY QUIETLY AND FASTEN THE THREAD ROUND HIS LEFT FOOT AS FIRMLY AS POSSIBLE
IT WILL NOT EVEN WET YOUR MOUTHS BUT THEY WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE IT AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT GIVE IT
CHARLES MARELLES FOR PERMISSION TO REPRODUCE HIS VERSIONS OF THE PIED PIPER OF DRAKESTAIL AND OF LITTLE GOLDEN HOOD FROM THE FRENCH AND M
I SHALL COME BACK DIRECTLY SO SHE FOUGHT AND STRUGGLED TO GET AWAY FROM HER HUSBAND AND TO GO WHERE THE VOICE SUMMONED
THANKS
PERHAPS THAT WILL PACIFY IT SO THE WIDOW WOMAN TOOK THE CHILD TO THE WOOD
WE WILL LOOK AT IT AND REMEMBER YOU SO PRINCE IVAN LEFT HIS SILVER SPOON AT THE FALCON'S AND WENT ON HIS WAY AGAIN
IN THE EVENING THE SEVEN DWARFS CAME HOME AND YOU MAY THINK WHAT A FRIGHT THEY GOT WHEN THEY SAW THEIR DEAR SNOWDROP LYING ON THE FLOOR AS STILL AND MOTIONLESS AS A DEAD PERSON
HAVING TAKEN SOME FOOD SHE LAID THE CHILD DOWN TO SLEEP IN A TROUGH THAT WAS ON THE FLOOR AND SAT DOWN HERSELF TO REST
I AM UNHAPPY ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE UNHAPPY MY PRINCESS CRIED HE
BRING HIM BACK TO ME THE SERVANTS MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE AFTER THE PRINCE
WHEN HE ANSWERED FIRMLY THAT HE WAS SHE CALLED UP THE APPEARANCE OF THE PRINCESS SUNBEAM TO THE OTHER END OF THE GALLERY AND SAID
WE HAVE BEEN IN ALL THE ROOMS OF OUR FATHER'S PALACE AND HAVE ADMIRED THE RICH AND BEAUTIFUL FURNITURE
THEN HE BENT A BRANCH DOWN FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND SAID
AND NOW THE EAGLE TOLD THE MAN WHAT HE WAS TO DO NEXT AND HE DID IT
AS IT WAS VERY SPIRITED HE LED IT BY THE BRIDLE AND THIS ARRANGEMENT ENABLED HIM TO TURN AND LOOK AT THE PRINCESS OFTEN WHICH HE DID NOT FAIL TO DO
THE HEADS CRIED HE IF YOU CARE ABOUT THEM GO AND FIND THEM IN THE RIVER SO REPLIED THE TOWN COUNSELLOR YOU REFUSE TO HOLD TO THE TERMS OF YOUR AGREEMENT
MICHAEL WAS PLACED NEXT TO THE ELDEST SISTER AND OPPOSITE TO THE YOUNGEST
ONCE MORE THE KING'S DAUGHTER WENT AND SOUGHT EVERYWHERE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE UNTIL AT LAST SHE CAME INTO THE STABLE AND WANTED TO GO INTO THE STALL BESIDE DAPPLEGRIM
THEN BEGAN A TREMENDOUS NOISE AND CONFUSION AND THEY KNEW THAT THE ENEMY HAD ARRIVED AND VERY SOON THEY HEARD THE KING HIMSELF STAMPING ABOUT THE PALACE SEEKING THE QUEEN
WITHOUT LOSING A MOMENT SHE RAN WITH IT TO FANFARONADE CRYING GAILY
SHE CAME RUNNING OUT AND FLUNG HERSELF ON HIS NECK CRYING
HOW PRETTY SHE IS THE PROCESSION CONSISTED OF THE QUEEN THE PRINCESS FIVE DOZEN OTHER PRINCESSES HER COUSINS AND TEN DOZEN WHO CAME FROM THE NEIGHBOURING KINGDOMS
WHAT DO YOU COME TO ASK OF ME THEN THE QUEEN TOLD HIM ALL THE FAIRIES HAD FORESEEN FOR ROSETTE AND ASKED WHAT SHE SHOULD DO AND THE HERMIT ANSWERED THAT SHE MUST SHUT THE PRINCESS UP IN A TOWER AND NEVER LET HER COME OUT OF IT AGAIN
BUT WHEN THE PRIEST HAD LAID HIS HANDS ON THE PRINCES AND READ THE BLESSING THEY WENT OUT OF THE CHURCH AGAIN AND CINDERLAD WENT OUT TOO BUT HE TOOK WITH HIM A FLASK OF WINE AND SOME CONSECRATED BREAD
BUT THE ROBBERS KNEW ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY TOLD THE YOUTH THAT IF HE COULD STEAL THIS AS HE HAD STOLEN THE TWO OTHERS HE SHOULD BE MASTER OF THE WHOLE TROOP
HE HAD THREE SISTERS
YOU MUST GIVE ME SAYS SHE THE FULL OF A PACK OF WOOL AND I HAVE AN ANCIENT CROCK WHICH YOU MUST FILL WITH BUTTER LIKEWISE A BARREL WHICH YOU MUST FILL FOR ME FULL OF WHEAT HOW MUCH WOOL WILL IT TAKE TO THE PACK SAYS THE QUEEN
NOW THERE LIVED AT THIS SAME COURT A VERY RICH OLD DUCHESS WHOSE NAME WAS GRUMBLY
AND SHE SAID HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER GLAD IN HIS HALL NEVER DRINKING WINE NEVER PLAYING CHESS NEVER EMBROIDERING WITH THE GOLDEN THREAD NEVER SPEAKING WORDS OF KINDNESS
THE QUEEN AND HER LADIES SET TO WORK TO PREPARE PRESENTS FOR THE FAIRIES WHO WERE INVITED
I KNOW WHAT IT IS
SO HE SHOWED HER THE TWO LAURELS WHICH HAD HELPED HIM AND SHE LIKE A PRUDENT GIRL THINKING THEY GAVE HIM TOO MUCH ADVANTAGE OVER HIS WIFE CUT THEM OFF AT THE ROOT AND THREW THEM IN THE FIRE
SO HE WANDERED ABOUT FOR SOME YEARS AS WRETCHED AND UNHAPPY AS HE COULD WELL BE AND AT LAST HE CAME TO THE DESERT PLACE WHERE RAPUNZEL WAS LIVING
SHE WAS KIND-HEARTED AND OF A FAIR COUNTENANCE AND SHE HAD A GOLD STAR RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FOREHEAD
SO THEY RUSHED AT EACH OTHER AND FOUGHT AND IT WAS SUCH A DREADFUL SIGHT THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER VERY NEARLY SWOONED
PRINCE IVAN WAS LEFT THERE ALONE
SURELY I CAN LET THE HONEST WOMAN IN THOUGHT SNOWDROP
WHAT GREAT THINGS WE HAVE SEEN AT THE PALACE
MAKE ME A LARGE VESSEL WITH A PARTITION IN THE MIDDLE SHE SAID
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WAS HE SO THOROUGHLY HAD HE ALTERED IN APPEARANCE THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING A PRINCE
A FEW OF THEM CERTAINLY MURMURED THAT A DRAKESTAIL WOULD MAKE A FINE KING
AT LENGTH ONE OF THEM CAUGHT IT JUST AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT TUBBY ENTERED THE KITCHEN WAVING HIS SCEPTRE
GET ON MY BACK FOR WE HAVE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO SO THE LAD DID THIS
AND AS SHE SEWED AND GAZED OUT TO THE WHITE LANDSCAPE SHE PRICKED HER FINGER WITH THE NEEDLE AND THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL ON THE SNOW OUTSIDE AND BECAUSE THE RED SHOWED OUT SO WELL AGAINST THE WHITE SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF
I HAVE CAUGHT A DOVE ANSWERED HE
HE GAVE HIS ARM TO THE ELDEST SISTER DANCED WITH EACH IN TURN AND WAS SO GRACEFUL THAT EVERYONE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM
AS SOON AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YOUTH WHO WAS RUNNING AFTER THE FOALS TILL THE PERSPIRATION STREAMED DOWN HIS FACE SHE CRIED
BUT THE COUNT IN HIS PRIDE REFUSED MORE THAN EVER TO GIVE HIS CONSENT TO THE MARRIAGE
AT LAST HER ARMS GREW SO TIRED THAT WHEN SHE DID MANAGE TO GET THE CAN PROPERLY UNDER THE WATER SHE HAD NO STRENGTH TO PULL IT UP AND IT ROLLED TO THE BOTTOM
WHEN SHE HAD GOT IT DONE ANOTHER AND A MUCH MORE UGLY AND HORRIBLE-LOOKING HEAD ROSE UP OUT OF THE WATER
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY THE WICKED WITCH CAME AND TURNED ME INTO THIS
BUT KARI SAID SHE THOUGHT THE PRIEST WAS SUCH A GOOD MAN AT PREACHING THAT SHE GOT SO MUCH BENEFIT FROM WHAT HE SAID AND AT LAST SHE GOT LEAVE
HE SENT TO FETCH RENELDE PLACED HER BY HIS BEDSIDE AND ORDERED HER AT ONCE TO GO ON SPINNING HIS SHROUD
I WILL GO AND SEEK MY BROTHERS TILL I FIND THEM SO SHE TOOK THE TWELVE SHIRTS AND WENT ON STRAIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG WOOD
THE OLD WITCH OF COURSE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON TILL ONE DAY RAPUNZEL NOT THINKING OF WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT TURNED TO THE WITCH AND SAID
DURING THE NIGHT THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT THE PIG HAD CHANGED INTO A MAN
SHE LOOKED OUT OVER THE COUNTRY THE FIRST THING BUT SEEING NOTHING SHE SAT DOWN TO REST A LITTLE AND ACCIDENTALLY LEANT BACK AGAINST THE WALL WHICH CURLICUE OR RATHER PRINCE PEERLESS HAD SO HASTILY MENDED
WHEN THE KING SAW THAT THE SEARCH WAS HOPELESS HE SAID
WHAT WAS HIS AMAZEMENT TO FIND THAT THE BEANS HAD GROWN UP IN THE NIGHT AND CLIMBED UP AND UP TILL THEY COVERED THE HIGH CLIFF THAT SHELTERED THE COTTAGE AND DISAPPEARED ABOVE IT
BLIND AND CRIPPLED THOUGH YE BE MOUNT YOUR STEEDS OR COME BY SEA AND SO THEY DROVE INTO THE KING'S FEAST ALL THE OUTCASTS AND THE MAIMED AND THE HALT AND THE BLIND
THE MAIDEN WHOSE FINGER THIS RING SLIPS OVER WHOSE HEAD THIS GOLDEN HOOP ENCIRCLES AND WHOSE FOOT THIS SHOE FITS SHALL BE MY BRIDE WHAT A GREAT TRYING ON THERE WAS NOW AMONG THEM ALL
YOU LITTLE GUESS THE ANXIETY HE HAS SUFFERED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE POWER OF THAT MISERABLE QUEEN THE PRINCESS KISSED HER GRATEFULLY AND PROMISED TO DO AS SHE WISHED IN EVERYTHING AND HOLDING OUT HER HAND TO PERCINET WITH A SMILE SHE SAID
THEN THEY ATE AND DRANK AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE LITTLE MAN SAID
BUT AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SOME TIME WITH MOTHER HOLLE SHE GREW SAD AND DEPRESSED AND AT FIRST SHE HARDLY KNEW HERSELF WHAT WAS THE MATTER
THEN GATHER THREE ORANGES AND GET BACK TO THE GATE AS FAST AS YOU CAN
WHAT A PRETTY GIRL SAID TUBBY
CUT IT DOWN AND AMONGST ITS ROOTS YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING WITH THAT THE LITTLE MAN TOOK LEAVE
EVERY DAY SHE SHALL GROW PRETTIER THE SECOND
FOR NOW SHE THOUGHT THE SHOWER OF GOLDEN RAIN WILL COME MOTHER HOLLE LED HER TO THE SAME DOOR AS SHE HAD DONE HER SISTER BUT WHEN SHE PASSED THROUGH IT INSTEAD OF THE GOLD RAIN A KETTLE FULL OF PITCH CAME SHOWERING OVER HER
IF YOU WEAR THEM YOU WILL GET TO MY BROTHER WHO LIVES HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM HERE
PERHAPS HIS TERRIBLE THIRST WAS A TRICK OF THE CUNNING WITCH AND SUPPOSE EVEN THOUGH HE OPENED THE ORANGE ON THE BANKS OF THE STREAM THAT HE DID NOT FIND IN IT THE PRINCESS THAT HE SOUGHT
SHE WORE A POINTED CAP OF QUILTED RED SATIN TURNED UP WITH ERMINE HER HAIR STREAMED LOOSE OVER HER SHOULDERS AND SHE WALKED WITH A STAFF
SHALL I MAKE YOU AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU DESERVE TO BE AH IF YOU ONLY WOULD CRIED THE PRINCESS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE HEARD A CRICK-CRACKING IN ALL HER BONES
THE GOOD MAN'S DAUGHTER HASTENED HOME AGAIN BETIMES BUT THE KING'S SON HAD SMEARED THE DOOR-POSTS WITH TAR AND THE GIRL'S GOLDEN CIRCLET STUCK TO IT
THEY ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE AND THE ELDEST SON AND SHE PLAYED THE FIRST GAME WHICH SHE WON
BUT THE KING STUCK TO WHAT HE HAD SAID AND IF THE YOUTH WERE UNABLE TO DO IT HE WAS TO LOSE HIS LIFE THE KING SAID
WHEN THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL HEARD OF THE BARGAIN THEY TOO EXCLAIMED
HIS QUEEN DID NOT LIKE THIS BUT WHEN HIS LONGING GREW SO GREAT THAT HE TOLD HER HE MUST AND WOULD GO SHE SAID TO HIM
IT IS NOT HER FAULT AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAS GROWN SO UGLY IT IS MINE
FATHER LET ME GO OUT AND CUT WOOD BUT HIS FATHER ANSWERED
GOOD-MORNING MY FINE COOK SHE SAID IN A SILVERY VOICE TO THE MAN WHO WAS WATCHING THE ROAST
THE FAIRY SMILED AT HER ASTONISHED LOOK AND SAID
IF MY BROTHER SAYS THAT I MUST DO IT BUT HEAVEN KNOWS HOW UNWILLING I AM TO THROW THEE OUT LITTLE SNOW SAID SHE
JUST AS SHE WAS STOOPING TO FILL IT SHE SAW REFLECTED IN THE WATER THE LOVELY IMAGE OF THE PRINCESS
AH HEAVEN BE PRAISED SHE CRIED I HAVE NOT SEEN A CHRISTIAN MAN SINCE I CAME HERE I HAVE COME FOR YOU SAID MINNIKIN
TWO HOURS AFTER THERE ARRIVED SOME SOLDIERS AND WHEN THEY SAW HER SPINNING THEY SEIZED HER TIED HER ARMS AND LEGS AND CARRIED HER TO THE BANK OF THE RIVER WHICH WAS SWOLLEN BY THE LATE RAINS
FOR THE SERVANT TOLD HER THAT THE GIANT HAD VOWED IF HE COULD FIND HER HE WOULD KILL BOTH HER AND HER BABY
BE FIRM HAPPEN WHAT MAY AND SEEK THE GOLDEN BRANCH ANSWERED THE GRASSHOPPER AND I THOUGHT THE COMMAND MUST BE FOR ME SO I STARTED AT ONCE THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THE WAY AT THIS MOMENT THEIR CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY TWO MICE WHO BREATHLESS FROM RUNNING FLUNG THEMSELVES HEADLONG THROUGH THE HOLE INTO THE TREE NEARLY CRUSHING THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET THOUGH THEY GOT OUT OF THE WAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD AND STOOD UP IN A DARK CORNER
HERE IS A PITCHER OF MILK
NOW THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WHO WAS VERY EXTRAVAGANT AND NEVER KEPT ANY MONEY HAVING HEARD THAT DRAKESTAIL HAD SOME WENT ONE DAY IN HIS OWN PERSON TO BORROW HIS HOARD AND MY WORD IN THOSE DAYS DRAKESTAIL WAS NOT A LITTLE PROUD OF HAVING LENT MONEY TO THE KING
LET ME HAVE A DROP SCREAMED ALL THE TWELVE AT ONCE
AT LAST THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO BURY HER BUT SHE LOOKED AS BLOOMING AS A LIVING BEING AND HER CHEEKS WERE STILL SUCH A LOVELY COLOUR THAT THEY SAID
AT THE SIGHT OF HER LOOKING SO CHANGED BY ALL THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED FOR HIS SAKE HIS HEART WAS MOVED BY SUCH LOVE AND LONGING AND BY SO GREAT A PITY THAT HE SUDDENLY BECAME A MAN
VERY WELL
YOU MAY BE CERTAIN I WAS IN GREAT PAIN BUT THE FEAR OF BEING KILLED PREVENTED ME FROM MAKING ANY COMPLAINT
OH HEAVENS
YOU OUGHT TO BE THINKING ALL THE TIME HOW HAPPY YOU ARE HAPPY CRIED HE
WHEN HE HAD BEEN AT HOME A FEW DAYS HE RODE OUT WITH REGIN ONE MORNING TO THE HEATH WHERE THE DRAGON USED TO LIE
NEXT MORNING THE BABA YAGA SENT HIM FORTH TO WATCH THE MARES
SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND FOR TEN YEARS OF THAT TIME THE WITCH HAD KEPT HER SHUT UP IN AN ORANGE IN THE SHAPE OF A CANARY
WHEREFORE O PRINCE IVAN--MY HUSBAND DEAR SHALT THOU BE!--WHEREFORE HAST THOU COME HITHER THEN HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHE SAID
A WHOLE YEAR HE LIVED WITHOUT HIS SISTERS
THE POOR QUEEN HELD HER LITTLE DAUGHTER SAFE IN HER ARMS AND SHRIEKED FOR MERCY BUT THE WICKED KING ONLY MOCKED HER AND BEGGED HER TO GO ON SHRIEKING AS IT AMUSED HIM AND SO MOUNTED HIS GREAT BLACK HORSE AND RODE BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO ESCAPE I ESCAPED DEATH MORE WONDERFULLY MYSELF SAYS THE THIEF OF SLOAN THAN IF YOU HAD HIM READY TO THROW INTO THE FURNACE AND I HOPE IT WILL BE THE CASE WITH HIM LIKEWISE WHY HAVE YOU BEEN IN ANOTHER GREAT DANGER SAYS THE KNIGHT
HA DEAR BROTHER-IN-LAW
THE KING REJOICED GREATLY BUT HE KEPT THE QUEEN IN HIDING TILL THE SUNDAY ON WHICH THE CHILD WAS TO BE CHRISTENED
HE TAKES THE SAME ROAD TO JOIN THE OTHERS WITH ALL HIS PARTY
III SOME WEEKS PASSED BEFORE BURCHARD APPEARED AGAIN
BEHOLD DRAKESTAIL MUCH ASTONISHED ALL ALONE IN THE BIG SALOON AND MASTER OF THE FIELD
NEVERTHELESS SHE PRESENTLY HIT UPON A PLAN
NO NO WAIT A LITTLE SCREAMED THE FATHER OF THE BOY
HE LED HER INTO THE HALL WHERE SHE WAS HIGHLY HONOURED
THEN THE BROTHER WAS AT ONCE TAKEN OUT OF THE SNAKE-PIT--THE SNAKES HAD NEVER TOUCHED HIM--AND THE STEP-MOTHER AND STEP-SISTER WERE FLUNG DOWN INTO IT INSTEAD OF HIM
THE THREE PRINCESSES OF WHITELAND THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A FISHERMAN WHO LIVED HARD BY A PALACE AND FISHED FOR THE KING'S TABLE
BUT WHEN RITTER RED SAW THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DANGER AFOOT HE LOST NO TIME IN CREEPING DOWN FROM THE TREE
BUT WHILE THEY WERE BUSY INSPECTING THE CORPSE AND THE VAULT TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD MISS I SLIPPED OUT AND ONCE AWAY AND STILL AWAY
HOW CLEVER YOU ALWAYS ARE SAID THE TROLL
AND WHAT VEXED HIM MORE THAN ALL WAS THAT THOUGH THE YOUNG LADIES THROUGHOUT ALL HIS LANDS DID THEIR BEST TO MAKE THE PRINCE FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ANY OF THEM AND TOLD HIS FATHER HE DID NOT WISH TO MARRY
DON'T HESITATE PRINCESS TO TELL YOUR DEVOTED SHEPHERD HOW DEARLY YOU LOVE HIM AS HE IS THE VERY PRINCE YOUR FATHER SENT YOU TO MARRY
ONE DAY WHEN THE LATTER ASKED HER MIRROR THE USUAL QUESTION IT REPLIED
DAPPLEGRIM TOLD HIM WHAT HE WAS TO DO THE SECOND TIME AND HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A LUMP OF EARTH AND STUCK HIMSELF BETWEEN THE HOOF AND THE SHOE ON DAPPLEGRIM'S LEFT FORE FOOT
I WONDER WHERE IT ENDS SAID JACK TO HIS MOTHER
BY THE TIME THE PRINCELY WORKMAN HAD GONE THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS THE PRINCESSES HAD RECEIVED WHAT THEY HAD ASKED FOR
I WISH TO SPEAK TO THE KING SPEAK TO THE KING
IS IT POSSIBLE SAID SHE THAT YOU WOULD NOT CARE IF I DIED OF HUNGER
NOT FAR FROM HERE ON A MOOR STAND THREE BROTHERS WHO HAVE STOOD THERE A HUNDRED YEARS FIGHTING FOR A HAT A CLOAK AND A PAIR OF BOOTS
SO RENELDE FORGAVE HIM AND WENT ON SPINNING NIGHT AND DAY
IN THE MIDST OF HER GRIEF SHE SUDDENLY HEARD HER MOTHER'S VOICE SPEAK FROM THE GRAVE AND SAY TO HER
SHE STEPPED IN AND FOUND A YOUTH WHO MARVELLING AT HER BEAUTY AT THE ROYAL ROBES SHE WORE AND AT THE GOLDEN STAR ON HER FOREHEAD ASKED HER WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND WHITHER SHE WAS GOING
THEIR LAST HOPE SEEMED GONE
THEN SHE SILENTLY LEFT THE ROOM AND NEXT MORNING WHEN THE NURSE ASKED THE SENTRIES IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO THE CASTLE THAT NIGHT THEY ALL SAID NO WE SAW NO ONE AT ALL FOR MANY NIGHTS THE QUEEN CAME IN THE SAME WAY BUT SHE NEVER SPOKE A WORD AND THE NURSE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HER VISITS
AND SHE WAKENED AND SAID AH
HE ASKED THE MOST DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING COCKCHAFER THEY MET IF HE KNEW WHERE THEY COULD FIND THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS
HE WALKED EAGERLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SOUND AND WHEN HE WAS QUITE CLOSE RAPUNZEL RECOGNISED HIM AND FELL ON HIS NECK AND WEPT
MARRIAGE IS EITHER A SUCCESS OR IT IS A FAILURE AT LAST BEING OF AN UNDECIDED CHARACTER AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE UP HIS MIND HE TOOK OFF HIS BOOT AND HANDING IT TO HIS DAUGHTER SAID
IS GONE LIKE A LETTER INTO THE POST
IF ONLY I HAD STRAWS ENOUGH I WOULD MAKE A BASKET WITH THEM AND LET MY BABY DOWN IN IT FROM THE WINDOW TO ANY KIND PASSER-BY WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER BY THE TIME THE STRAWS WERE ALL PLAITED THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD DRAGGED IN MORE AND MORE UNTIL THE QUEEN HAD PLENTY TO MAKE HER BASKET AND SHE WORKED AT IT DAY AND NIGHT WHILE THE LITTLE MOUSE DANCED FOR HER AMUSEMENT
SHE WENT AND SOON RETURNED WITH TWO LARGE BAGS OVER HER SHOULDERS WHICH SHE PUT DOWN BY HER HUSBAND
JACK DETERMINED AT ONCE TO ATTEMPT THE ADVENTURE
AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SEE ANY KEYHOLE BUT AFTER A CAREFUL SEARCH HE FOUND ONE HIDDEN IN THE CARVING AND THE GOLDEN KEY JUST FITTED IT
HAVING DONE THIS HE GRASPED THE SWORD AND SMOTE THE TROLL DEAD
OH WONDERFUL
STILL HE COULD NOT KEEP AWAY THE CURSE WHICH WAS TO COME ON EVERY ONE WHO OWNED THE TREASURE OF THE DWARF ANDVARI AND HIS FATAL GOLDEN RING
HE COMMANDED THAT THE FURNACE SHOULD BE HEATED AND THIS TAIL OF A DRAKE THROWN INTO IT BECAUSE HE MUST BE A SORCERER
AH POOR CREATURE WHAT A MASTER YOU MUST HAVE TO TREAT YOU THUS SHE SAID AND PUSHED THE HALTER OFF THE HOOK SO THAT THE HORSE MIGHT TURN ROUND AND EAT THE OATS
TAKE THE CHILD OUT INTO THE WOOD AND NEVER LET ME SEE HER FACE AGAIN
THE FAIRY STOPPED HER CARRIAGE AND ADDRESSED THEM
SHE KNOCKED AND BEGGED FOR ADMISSION
AT LAST ONE EVENING AS THE QUEEN SAT AT HER SPINNING-WHEEL--FOR THE KING WAS SO AVARICIOUS THAT SHE WAS MADE TO WORK DAY AND NIGHT--SHE SAW A TINY PRETTY LITTLE MOUSE CREEP OUT OF A HOLE AND SAID TO IT
ALL SHALL GO WELL WITH IT AND I WILL LOOK AFTER IT LIKE A MOTHER THE MAN IN HIS TERROR AGREED TO EVERYTHING SHE ASKED AND AS SOON AS THE CHILD WAS BORN THE WITCH APPEARED AND HAVING GIVEN IT THE NAME OF RAPUNZEL WHICH IS THE SAME AS RAMPION SHE CARRIED IT OFF WITH HER
WHEN SHE SAW WHAT A FIGURE HER GRANNY CUT IN BED THE POOR LITTLE THING WAS MUCH SURPRISED
IT WOULD BE SO UNCOMFORTABLE
NOW YOU ARE IN PURGATORY SAID THE MASTER THIEF AND OFF HE WENT AND TOOK THE GOLD AND THE SILVER AND ALL THE PRECIOUS THINGS WHICH THE PRIEST HAD LAID TOGETHER IN HIS BEST PARLOUR
THEN SHE TOOK THE GIRL AND OPENED THE LOCKED-UP ROOM
DO YOU SEE THOSE TALL NETTLES THAT GROW ON THE TOMBS IN THE CHURCHYARD
LET US GO OUT AND STROLL IN THE GARDEN GREEN THEY STROLLED ABOUT FOR A TIME
THEN SHE MADE HERSELF LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE WOMAN AND CALLED OUT TO THE GOOD MAN
COME TO THE WOOD WITH ME HOWEVER
AFTER SUPPER THEY WENT INTO ANOTHER LOVELY ROOM WHERE THE CRYSTAL WALLS WERE COVERED WITH PICTURES AND THE PRINCESS SAW WITH GREAT SURPRISE THAT HER OWN HISTORY WAS REPRESENTED EVEN DOWN TO THE MOMENT WHEN PERCINET FOUND HER IN THE FOREST
NOW THIS WAS WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SAY RATHER UNHAPPY
BUT THE EAGLE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT FIRST AND THEN IT WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY FOR IT WAS SO TIRED WITH THE LONG JOURNEY THAT IT WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO RISE FROM THE EARTH
SHE LIVES SIX HUNDRED MILES OFF BUT YOU SHALL HAVE MY HORSE AND CARRIAGE AND THEN YOU WILL GET THERE BY NIGHTFALL SO THE MAN SET OFF AND HE GOT THERE BY NIGHTFALL
BUT THE KING LOOKED KINDLY AT HER HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SAID WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO MY CASTLE AND BE MY DEAR WIFE OH YES REPLIED THE MAIDEN BUT YOU MUST LET MY ROE COME TOO
WITH THE EARLIEST DAWN THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY AND THOUGH THE MICE WERE IN CONSTANT FEAR OF BEING OVERTAKEN OR TRAPPED THEY REACHED THE GOLDEN BRANCH IN SAFETY
THE FACT WAS HE THOUGHT THEM VERY UGLY WITH THEIR SUN-BURNT NECKS THEIR GREAT RED HANDS THEIR COARSE PETTICOATS AND THEIR WOODEN SHOES
THERE THE OLD MAN LIGHTED A FIRE OF STRAW AND THEN DREW FROM AN OLD BOX HIS WIFE'S DRESS AND SHOES WHICH THE PRINCESS PUT ON AND THUS ROUGHLY CLAD LOOKED AS CHARMING AS POSSIBLE AND FRISK DANCED HIS VERY BEST TO AMUSE HER
HOWEVER EVERYONE WAS ANXIOUS TO HEAR THE QUEEN'S COMMANDS IN REGARD TO THE TWO PRINCES NOT THINKING THAT SHE HAD ANY ILL DESIGN IN HER HEAD AGAINST THEM
HAVE YOU GOT DONE ALREADY OH YES I ONLY PUT HIM INTO A HOLE SAID HE AND RAKED A LITTLE EARTH OVER HIM
BROTHER DON'T DRINK YET OR YOU'LL BECOME A ROE AND RUN AWAY FROM ME BUT HER BROTHER WAS ALREADY KNEELING BY THE BROOK AND BENDING OVER IT TO DRINK AND SURE ENOUGH NO SOONER HAD HIS LIPS TOUCHED THE WATER THAN HE FELL ON THE GRASS TRANSFORMED INTO A LITTLE ROEBUCK
ON SUNDAY SOME STRANGERS WERE COMING TO THE KING'S PALACE SO KARI BEGGED TO HAVE LEAVE TO CARRY UP THE WATER FOR THE PRINCE'S BATH BUT THE OTHERS LAUGHED AT HER AND SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT THERE
WELL IT WASN'T FOR NOTHING THAT YOU GAVE YOURSELF SO MUCH TROUBLE
HE HAD CROOKED LEGS AND SQUINTING EYES A LARGE MOUTH ALL ON ONE SIDE AND A HUNCHBACK
AND AS HE TURNED AWAY A YOUNG BOAR CAME RUNNING PAST SO HE SHOT IT AND BROUGHT ITS LUNGS AND LIVER HOME TO THE QUEEN AS A PROOF THAT SNOWDROP WAS REALLY DEAD
NEVER WAS THERE A BEAUTIFUL SOUL IN SUCH A FRIGHTFUL LITTLE BODY BUT IN SPITE OF HIS APPEARANCE EVERYBODY LOVED HIM
YOU HAVE BURNT MY SKIN
WHY STUMBLEST THOU
AS HE HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PREPARE HIS SPEECH BEFOREHAND THE KING ORDERED THAT SILENCE SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THREE HOURS AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
IT MUST BE FOR MY PRIDE THAT I AM CONDEMNED TO BE A GRASSHOPPER AND SING DAY AND NIGHT IN THE GRASS BY THIS BROOK WHEN I FEEL FAR MORE INCLINED TO CRY IN THE MEANTIME PRINCE PEERLESS HAD DISCOVERED THE PRINCESS'S ABSENCE AND WAS LAMENTING OVER IT BY THE RIVER'S BRIM WHEN HE SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF A LITTLE OLD WOMAN
BUT PRINCESS SAID HE I DARE NOT TAKE YOU BACK TO KING MERLIN'S COURT
THE SPINNER SPUN NO MORE
AT ALL EVENTS LEAVE WITH US YOUR SILVER SPOON
SHE REALLY COULD NOT IMAGINE WHERE ALL THE NICE THINGS CAME FROM
WHEN HE CAME IN SIGHT OF THE CASTLE HE WAS AGAIN JUST A LITTLE AFRAID
WHEN HE HAD WALKED FOR SOME TIME HE CAME TO A GREAT WOOD AND IT STRETCHED BEFORE HIM ALL DAY LONG AS HE WENT ON AND WHEN NIGHT BEGAN TO FALL HE SAW A GREAT LIGHT AND WENT TOWARDS IT
IN THAT CASE SAID THE ENCHANTER TOUCHING HER YOU HAD BETTER BECOME A PARTICULAR KIND OF CREATURE THAT IS NEITHER FISH NOR FOWL
IV WHEN HE REACHED THE CASTLE MICHAEL WENT STRAIGHT TO THE GARDENER AND OFFERED HIS SERVICES
WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT HE PERCEIVED SOME WOOD-CUTTERS WHO MIGHT OBSERVE HIM AND HE CHANGED HIS MIND
DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW SAID THE FOAL
BUT WHEN SHE CAME TO THE COTTAGE TO SEE SHE FOUND THE WHEEL SILENT
NOW SNOWDROP'S WICKED STEP-MOTHER WAS ONE OF THE GUESTS INVITED TO THE WEDDING FEAST
AND DRAKESTAIL QUITE CONTENT BEGAN TO SING AGAIN QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK WHEN THE KING WHO WAS STILL AT TABLE HEARD THIS REFRAIN AND THE POULTRY WOMAN CAME TO TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THE YARD HE WAS TERRIBLY ANNOYED
GOOD EVENING A PIECE OF GOLD FELL OUT OF HER MOUTH
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO GO UP TO THE FARM
AFTER A TIME HE SAID TO HIMSELF AGAIN
IT OUGHT TO BRING HER GOOD LUCK FOR IT WAS MADE OF A RAY OF SUNSHINE SHE SAID
A TERRIBLE STORM AROSE
THEN ALL THE DUKES AND COUNSELLORS PUT THE GREAT PRINCE UPON A GOLDEN THRONE AND CROWNED HIM WITH A DIAMOND CROWN AND THEY ALL CRIED LONG LIVE THE KING AND AFTER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FEASTING AND REJOICING
WE ALSO ARE ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE GOLDEN BRANCH THE MICE COURTEOUSLY ASSENTED AND AFTER MANY POLITE SPEECHES THE WHOLE PARTY FELL ASLEEP
THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE NIGHT BEFORE HE HAD DISOBEYED THE ORDERS OF THE OLD MAN
RAPUNZEL IS LOST TO YOU FOR EVER--YOU WILL NEVER SEE HER MORE THE PRINCE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH GRIEF AND IN HIS DESPAIR HE JUMPED RIGHT DOWN FROM THE TOWER AND THOUGH HE ESCAPED WITH HIS LIFE THE THORNS AMONG WHICH HE FELL PIERCED HIS EYES OUT
AND IF THEY ARE NOT DEAD THEY ARE STILL LIVING AND RULING HAPPILY.(8 8 RUMANISCHE MARCHEN UBERSETZT VON NITE KREMNITZ
HE THEN ENTERED HIS PALACE AND THE THREE PRINCESSES STEPPED FORWARD TO MEET HIM
THE PRINCE OR SOME ONE ELSE MIGHT VERY EASILY CATCH SIGHT OF HER THEY SAID AND THEN BOTH SHE AND THEY WOULD SUFFER FOR IT
WHEN SHE CAME BACK TO THE COTTAGE DOOR WITH HER PAILS SHE CALLED TO HER MOTHER WHO WAS INSIDE OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR YOURSELF MY OWN DEAR CHILD SAID THE MOTHER
WHEREFORE TAKE ME HOME WITH YOU AGAIN CRIED THE YOUNG WOMAN SINCE THE WITCH IS SURE TO EAT ME UP SHE WILL NOT EAT YOU UP ANSWERED HER HUSBAND
AFTER A TIME BENJAMIN SAID
IT WAS MUCH MORE SPLENDID THAN THE OTHER BUT HERE TOO THERE WAS NOT A HUMAN BEING TO BE SEEN
NOW MY MAN AND WHAT'S AMISS WITH YOU SAID THE GOVERNOR
CHILD SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHAT A FIGURE YOU'VE GOT
SO SHE WENT ABOUT WITH THE CATTLE AND HERDED THEM IN THE WOODS AND IN THE FIELDS
SO SHE GAVE HIM A RING WHICH ENABLED HIM WHO WORE IT TO OBTAIN TWO WISHES
SO HE SOON SAW WHAT KIND OF MEAD IT WAS AND SET OUT HOMEWARDS
MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS MAYBLOSSOM WHO WAS BY THIS TIME TERRIBLY SLEEPY HAD FOUND A GRASSY BANK IN THE SHADE AND THROWING HERSELF DOWN HAD ALREADY FALLEN INTO A PROFOUND SLUMBER WHEN FANFARONADE WHO HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY AND NOT SLEEPY CAME AND WOKE HER UP SAYING VERY CROSSLY
IT IS A GREAT GRIEF TO ME TO LEAVE YOU ALL
HE LOOKED SO DISTINGUISHED THAT HARDLY ANYONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO HE WAS
THEN HE CALLED TO HER
THIS WAS REPEATED FOR TWO NIGHTS AND ON THE THIRD THE DUCK SAID TO THE SCULLION
OH CRIES SHE HOW LIKE YOU ARE TO FRIEND WOLF GRANDMOTHER THAT'S ON ACCOUNT OF MY NIGHT-CAP CHILD REPLIES THE WOLF
JUST YOU WAIT WHERE YOU ARE TILL I RETURN SAID THE MUSICIAN AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY AGAIN
THERE HE FOUND A BED ON WHICH HE LAY DOWN TO REST
LATE IN THE EVENING HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT AND IT WAS VERY MUCH MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS
BUT THE BULL WAS THEN SO WEAK AND WORN OUT THAT IT WAS ONLY WITH PAIN AND EFFORT THAT HE COULD MOVE AND SO COVERED WITH WOUNDS THAT THE BLOOD STREAMED FROM HIM
YOU STUPID THING YOU WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING YES INDEED WHAT CAN I KNOW REPLIED THE GIRL
HE SOON SAW THE PRINCESS AND FRISK FLOATING UP AND DOWN AND ROSETTE STRETCHING OUT HER HANDS TO HIM CRIED
SHE WENT AWAY TO THE ROCK AND KNOCKED AT IT WITH THE STICK AND THEN THE MAN CAME OUT AND GAVE HER A GOWN WHICH WAS VERY MUCH MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS
THEY RAN WITH PIKES AND MATTOCKS TO THE MOUNTAIN AND SEARCHED TILL EVENING TO FIND THE OPENING BY WHICH THEIR CHILDREN HAD DISAPPEARED WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT
YOU ARE MOST FAIR MY LADY QUEEN NONE FAIRER IN THE LAND I WEEN THEN HER JEALOUS HEART WAS AT REST--AT LEAST AS MUCH AT REST AS A JEALOUS HEART CAN EVER BE
BUT THEN ALL THAT THE YOUTH HAD FORETOLD CAME TO PASS
THEN THE GOOD WIFE MET A WITCH WHO SAID TO HER
THE YOUTH WENT DOWN TO THE STABLE AGAIN AND VERY SAD AND SORROWFUL HE WAS AS ANYONE MAY WELL IMAGINE
IN THE EVENING WHEN SISTER WAS TIRED SHE SAID HER PRAYERS AND THEN LAID HER HEAD ON THE FAWN'S BACK AND FELL SOUND ASLEEP WITH IT AS A PILLOW
SO I TOOK MY SWORD AND CUT OFF THE TOE IT WAS FASTENED ON AND THREW BOTH INTO A LARGE FISH-POND THAT WAS CONVENIENT
AND THE PRINCE SEEING THAT IT WAS OF NO USE TO REMONSTRATE BOWED AND RETIRED
AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL HAVE SPENT AN HOUR OR TWO TOGETHER SO THEY GOT READY AND FLED
PAR MADAME D'AULNOY
I MIGHT HAVE EATEN IT UP ALL BY MYSELF BUT I HAD RATHER SHARE IT WITH YOU BUT WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER OR THANKING HER HE SNATCHED THE HONEY COMB OUT OF HER HANDS AND ATE IT ALL UP--EVERY BIT WITHOUT OFFERING HER A MORSEL
BUT HE TOOK CARE NOT TO BE INTOXICATED EITHER BY THE WINE OR THE COMPLIMENTS
THIS TIME SHE SAID TO HERSELF I WILL THINK OF SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE AN END OF HER ONCE AND FOR ALL AND BY THE WITCHCRAFT WHICH SHE UNDERSTOOD SO WELL SHE MADE A POISONOUS COMB
VIII EVERYTHING THE PRINCESS SAW WAS NEW TO HER AND IN PASSING THROUGH MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND TOWNS SHE ASKED A THOUSAND QUESTIONS
SHE WAS CAREFULLY HOLDING THE BOX UPON HER LAP WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FELT THE GREATEST DESIRE TO OPEN IT
ONCE IN PARTICULAR AS I WAS ON MY RAMBLING I WAS BENIGHTED AND COULD FIND NO LODGING
NO THAT WILL NOT DO SAID JACK FOR THEN FARMER WEATHERBEARD WILL MAKE THE KING FALL SICK AND THERE WILL BE NO ONE WHO CAN MAKE HIM WELL AGAIN BEFORE FARMER WEATHERBEARD COMES AND CURES HIM AND FOR THAT HE WILL DEMAND THE GOLD RING I WILL SAY THAT IT WAS MY MOTHER'S AND THAT I WILL NOT PART WITH IT SAID THE PRINCESS
I AM SURE THAT BREAD AND WATER SHARED WITH FANFARONADE WILL PLEASE ME FAR BETTER THAN ROAST CHICKEN AND SWEETMEATS WITH ANYBODY ELSE AND SO SHE WENT ON TALK TALK TALKING UNTIL HER WAITING-WOMEN WONDERED WHERE SHE GOT IT ALL FROM
I AM QUITE TIRED ENOUGH OF SEEING MYSELF I TELL YOU THAT YOU SHALL MARRY HER CRIED KING GRUMPY ANGRILY
THE PRINCESS HAD BEEN NAMED MAYBLOSSOM BECAUSE SHE WAS AS FRESH AND BLOOMING AS SPRING ITSELF AND SHE GREW UP TALL AND BEAUTIFUL AND EVERYTHING SHE DID AND SAID WAS CHARMING
THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL NIGHTS RUNNING AND THE PRINCESS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL
HE HAD A FAIR AND BELOVED WIFE AND SEVERAL LOVELY CHILDREN
IF I DO NOT MISTAKE YOU COME FROM FAR
CATCH ALL SORTS OF GAME AND PUT THEM INTO ONE HALF OF IT AND INTO THE OTHER HALF POUR WATER
WHAT MAKES THE CHILD SO RESTLESS ASKED THE PRINCE AND HE WENT TO A WISE WIDOW WOMAN TO ASK HER ADVICE
IN FUTURE YOU MUST BE SURE TO LET NO ONE IN IF WE ARE NOT AT HOME AS SOON AS THE WICKED OLD QUEEN GOT HOME SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO HER MIRROR AND SAID
IS SHE PRETTIER THAN HER PORTRAIT SIRE THEY ANSWERED IF SHE WERE AS PRETTY THAT WOULD DO VERY WELL THAT'S TRUE SAID THE KING
IT WILL TAKE THE INCREASE OF SEVEN BARRELS OF WHEAT FOR SEVEN YEARS THAT IS A GREAT QUANTITY SAYS THE QUEEN
AND HE CAME UP WITH THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA AS SHE WAS GOING HER WAY LAID HOLD OF HER AND CARRIED HER OFF HOME WITH HIM
BUT ONE DAY WHILE THEY WERE ALL SIT-TING TOGETHER ROUND THE TABLE HIS WIFE SUDDENLY STARTED UP EXCLAIMING IN A LOUD VOICE
AT FIRST HE WAS VERY MUCH STARTLED BY GRACIOSA'S SUDDEN APPEARANCE BUT SHE TOLD HIM HOW THE QUEEN HAD LEFT HER OUT IN THE FOREST AND HOW SHE HAD CAUSED A LOG OF WOOD TO BE BURIED
THE BARBER WHO WENT HOME WHISTLING AND CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON THE ESCAPE HE HAD MADE DESCRIBED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND IT WAS NOISED ABROAD IN THE COUNTRY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAD GONE AWAY AND HAD NEVER RETURNED HAD ALL FALLEN INTO THAT PIT
WHEN THE MASTER THIEF GOT THERE THE MARE WENT ALONG SO SLOWLY AND QUIETLY THAT THE CART HARDLY SEEMED TO MOVE FROM THE SPOT
CAN YOU FIGHT ROARED THE TROLL
CAN YOU FIGHT ROARED THE TROLL
THEN THEY ARRANGED WITH EACH OTHER THAT EACH SHOULD CHOOSE HIS OWN QUARTER AND ONE SHOULD GO EAST AND THE OTHER WEST
I'LL EAT ONE OF THESE CHICKENS DON'T EAT IT PRINCE IVAN BEGS THE OUTLANDISH BIRD
THERE WAS JOY AND GLADNESS IN THE PALACE AS MAY BE IMAGINED AND THE KING DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOW ENOUGH HONOUR AND RESPECT TO RITTER RED
ONE GROS A HEAD IS ONE HEAD THE GROS
THE EAGLE TOOK HER AND CARRIED HER OFF TO HIS OWN KINGDOM
THEN HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN AND THE NEXT DAY THEY SET OFF ONCE MORE
ACROSS THEM SHE PLACED THE OTHER BONES PIECE BY PIECE LIKE THE STEPS OF A LADDER
ALL NIGHT LONG SHE RAN FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNTIL AT LAST DRIVEN QUITE FRANTIC BY TERROR AND WANT OF SLEEP THE KING RUSHED OUT OF THE PALACE CRYING
AH WELL SAID THE GOVERNOR IT IS EASY TO SEE WHO HAS BEEN HERE
I WILL NOT HEAR OF HER BEING MADE TO MARRY THE WICKED KING'S SON SHE SAID
THEN SHE TOLD WHAT HAD HAP-PENED TO HER IN THE WOOD AND AT EVERY WORD PIECES OF GOLD DROPPED FROM HER MOUTH SO THAT THE ROOM WAS SOON COVERED WITH THEM
THEN SHE WENT ON TO THE THIRD CASK TAP TAP AND OUT CAME SUCH A STREAM OF DIAMONDS AND PEARLS THAT THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THEM
SO THE YOUTH DID THIS--HE KILLED ALL THE TWELVE FOALS AND THEN WENT BACK AGAIN
THEN SHE RENT ALL HER NEEDLEWORK ASUNDER AND WEPT ALOUD SO THAT EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE HEARD HER
BUT BEFORE THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY THE PRINCESS INSISTED THAT HER LOVER SHOULD TELL HER HOW HE CAME TO DISCOVER THE SECRET
I AM RESOLVED THEREFORE NOT TO STAY HERE BUT TO GO WITH THEM LET WHAT WILL BETIDE
ONCE MORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THEY MADE HER DO ALL THE HARD WORK AND HARD WORDS FELL TO HER LOT EARLY AND LATE BUT LITTLE ENOUGH FOOD ACCOMPANIED THEM
STILL WITH ALL HIS PRACTICE HE SHOT VERY BADLY HE WAS SO FAT AND HEAVY AND AS HE GREW DAILY FATTER HE WAS AT LAST OBLIGED TO GIVE UP WALKING AND BE DRAGGED ABOUT IN A WHEEL-CHAIR AND THE PEOPLE MADE FUN OF HIM AND GAVE HIM THE NAME OF MY LORD TUBBY
WHEN SHE WAS LEFT BY HERSELF THE POOR GIRL BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID
THE KING LIFTED THE LONELY MAIDEN ON TO HIS HORSE AND LED HER TO HIS CASTLE WHERE THE WEDDING WAS CELEBRATED WITH THE GREATEST SPLENDOUR
SO HE CLIMBED THE BEANSTALK ONCE MORE AND BLEW THE HORN AT THE GIANT'S GATE
WELL THE TRUE STORY HAPPENED QUITE DIFFERENTLY AS WE KNOW NOW
BUT WHEN HE RECOGNISED THE QUEEN HE SAID
THERE YOU MAY SEE THE PALACE TO WHICH WE ARE BOUND SAID HE
WELL WHAT A TIME IT HAS TAKEN TO LOCK THE HOUSE DOOR FATHER SAID HIS WIFE AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE SHEET AND THE NIGHT-GOWN WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED THE GOVERNOR
YOU SAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE TO ANYTHING I LIKED SO I APPRENTICED MYSELF TO SOME THIEVES AND ROBBERS AND NOW I HAVE SERVED MY TIME AND HAVE BECOME MASTER THIEF NOW THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE LIVED BY HIS FATHER'S COTTAGE AND THIS GOVERNOR HAD SUCH A LARGE HOUSE AND SO MUCH MONEY THAT HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH IT WAS AND HE HAD A DAUGHTER TOO WHO WAS BOTH PRETTY AND DAINTY AND GOOD AND WISE
HAVE HER THOU SHALT AS I HAVE SAID IT
WHAT IS IT
I HAVE TO GO AND GET MY SON APPRENTICED TO SOMEONE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO TEACH HIM A TRADE FOR MY OLD WOMAN COMES OF SUCH WELL-TO-DO FOLK THAT SHE INSISTS ON HIS BEING TAUGHT TO BE MASTER OF ALL MASTERS SAID THE MAN
TAKING A HAMMER HE BROKE AWAY A BIT OF THE STONE AND FOUND BEHIND IT A LITTLE GOLDEN KEY
SHE BADE HIM STAY QUITE STILL THERE OR THE GIANT WOULD EAT HIM
HE DREW OUT AN ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITH HIS KNIFE
NOW THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF INTO THE MOUNTAINS BY A TROLL AND THE KING HAD NO OTHER CHILDREN AND FOR THIS CAUSE BOTH HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE WERE FULL OF SORROW AND AFFLICTION AND THE KING HAD PROMISED THE PRINCESS AND HALF HIS KINGDOM TO ANYONE WHO COULD SET HER FREE
SO THEY PARTED ONCE MORE AND EACH TOOK HIS OWN ROAD BUT IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN--THEY MET EACH OTHER BEFORE THEY WERE AT ALL AWARE AND SO IT HAPPENED THE THIRD TIME ALSO
HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE TROLL BUT HE WANTED SOME MEAT AND DRINK FOR HE WAS HUNGRY AFTER HIS JOURNEY
BY THE TIME THEY REACHED THE PIG'S DWELLING WHICH STOOD IN A THICK WOOD IT WAS QUITE DARK
AND SHE WAS SO LIKE THE OTHER LOAVES THAT NO ONE COULD SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
SHE WOULD NEED TO BE A FAIRY TO DO IT THE QUEEN WAS MORE THAN DELIGHTED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE DESPAIR THIS TASK WOULD CAUSE THE PRINCESS
THEN HE KNEW HIS SON WAS DEAD AND TO PUNISH THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED HIM HE SAID HE MUST HAVE THE OTTER'S SKIN FILLED WITH GOLD AND COVERED ALL OVER WITH RED GOLD OR IT SHOULD GO WORSE WITH HIM
HE WENT FAR AND WIDE TO INQUIRE FOR THAT COUNTRY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE CAME BUT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD TELL HIM WHERE IT LAY SO HE WAS FORCED TO HAVE PATIENCE ONCE MORE
I SHOULD SO LIKE TO GO AND AMUSE MYSELF WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN WELL WELL GO THEN SAID THE KITCHEN-MAID BUT DON'T LET ME FIND YOU STAYING THERE OVER THE TIME WHEN THE PAN HAS TO BE SET ON THE FIRE FOR SUPPER AND THE ROAST PUT ON THE SPIT
HAS NOT OUR FATHER ENOUGH SOLDIERS TO PROTECT YOU EVEN IF THE DISGUSTING CREATURE DID COME TO WOO YOU THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS WOULD FAIN HAVE LET HERSELF BE CONVINCED BY HER SISTERS WORDS AND HAVE BELIEVED WHAT THEY SAID BUT HER HEART WAS HEAVY
SOMEBODY HAS LAIN ON OURS TOO BUT WHEN THE SEVENTH CAME TO HIS BED HE STARTED BACK IN AMAZEMENT FOR THERE HE BEHELD SNOWDROP FAST ASLEEP
THEY MUST MEAN TO KILL US AND THIS IDEA ANNOYED THEM VERY MUCH
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
WHAT A TIME I'VE BEEN SLEEPING YOU'D HAVE GONE ON SLEEPING A GOOD DEAL LONGER IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR US REPLIED HIS BROTHERS-IN-LAW
HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SAID NO AND BADE HIM LOOK AT HIS BROTHER'S BACK BUT THE YOUTH WOULD NOT GIVE UP HIS DESIGN AND STUCK TO IT AND AFTER A LONG LONG TIME HE GOT LEAVE TO GO AND SET FORTH ON HIS WAY
AND A CLOUD OF VENOM FLEW BEFORE HIM AS HE SNORTED AND ROARED SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEATH TO STAND BEFORE HIM
THERE THE PRINCE HELD GRACIOSA'S HAND IN HIS AND MADE HER PUT THE TIP OF HER LITTLE FINGER INTO HER MOUTH AND LOOK TOWARDS THE TOWN AND IMMEDIATELY SHE SAW THE WICKED QUEEN GO TO THE KING AND HEARD HER SAY TO HIM THAT MISERABLE PRINCESS IS DEAD AND NO GREAT LOSS EITHER
BUT WON'T YOU EXCHANGE HIM WITH ME
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL SAID THE DUCHESS SMILING MORE THAN BEFORE
TOC WHO IS THERE ASKS THE PORTER PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WICKET
NOW BEING SO RICH AND HAVING SO MUCH TO LOSE HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE THING TO DIE AND LEAVE ALL HIS POSSESSIONS BEHIND
AND THE KING ORDERED THE PAGE TO COME AND LEAD THE QUEEN'S HORSE
SO SIGURD WENT WITHIN THE CASTLE DOOR AND THERE HE SAW SOMEONE SLEEPING CLAD ALL IN ARMOUR
IF I GIVE YOU MY CAKE AND WINE I SHALL HAVE NONE LEFT FOR MYSELF
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
PERHAPS MY MOTHER WILL KNOW ME BY THAT TOKEN SCARCELY HAD SHE SPOKEN WHEN A GOLDEN HEMLOCK SPRANG UP FROM HER AND STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE
HALVOR FOLLOWED THIS AND WHEN EVENING DREW NEAR HE SAW A BIG CASTLE FAR AWAY IN THE DISTANCE AND THERE WERE LIGHTS IN IT
MOREOVER THE GIANTESS WAS VERY KIND TO ME THE FAIRY SMILED ON JACK
I CANNOT ASK PERCINET TO HELP ME AGAIN FOR IF HE REALLY LOVED ME HE WOULD NOT WAIT TILL I CALLED HIM HE WOULD COME WITHOUT THAT I AM HERE MY GRACIOSA CRIED PERCINET SPRINGING OUT OF THE BARREL WHERE HE HAD BEEN HIDING
WHAT HAIRY ARMS YOU'VE GOT GRANDMOTHER ALL THE BETTER TO HUG YOU MY CHILD OH
NOW GO OVER FRESH WATER AND SALT WATER OVER HIGH HILLS AND DEEP DALES AND DO NOT STOP UNTIL THOU COMEST TO THE KING'S PALACE AND IN AN INSTANT THE SHIP WENT AWAY AS SWIFTLY AS ANY BIRD IN THE AIR TILL IT GOT JUST BELOW THE KING'S PALACE AND THERE IT STOOD STILL
BUT JACK PUT THE BROWN HEN DOWN BEFORE HER AND TOLD HER HOW HE HAD BEEN IN THE GIANT'S CASTLE AND ALL HIS ADVENTURES
OH BUT WHAT I HAVE IS SO LITTLE WHIMPERED THE OLD WOMAN
STORY FROM HAINAUT
SO AT LAST HE CALLED HIS SONS TOGETHER AND SAID WHOEVER WILL DESTROY THE NORKA TO HIM WILL I GIVE THE HALF OF MY KINGDOM WELL THE ELDEST SON UNDERTOOK THE TASK
THEN THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS BY DEGREES FOR THE BULL SAID THAT THEY HAD STILL A LITTLE FARTHER TO GO AND IN THIS WAY THEY CROSSED MANY HIGH HILLS AND THICK WOODS
I ONLY HAVE THREE PEAS FOR MY DAY'S PROVISION SO UNLESS YOU WISH TO FAST YOU MUST GO ELSEWHERE BUT THE MOUSE RAN HITHER AND THITHER AND DANCED AND CAPERED SO PRETTILY THAT AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE IT HER LAST PEA WHICH SHE WAS KEEPING FOR HER SUPPER SAYING
WHEN THE PRINCESSES SAW THAT THE CLOTHES WERE THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN THEIRS IN THE OTHER WORLD THEY GUESSED THAT PRINCE IVAN WAS IN THIS WORLD SO THEY EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH EACH OTHER BUT THEY HELD THEIR PEACE
THE GREAT CLOCK WAS IN THE TURRET AS SHE KNEW THOUGH THE WEIGHTS HUNG DOWN INTO THE GALLERY
THE DEATH OF KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS IN A CERTAIN KINGDOM THERE LIVED A PRINCE IVAN
WONDERFUL GROWTH OF THE BEANSTALK SO JACK CALLED HIS MOTHER AND THEY BOTH GAZED IN SILENT WONDER AT THE BEANSTALK WHICH WAS NOT ONLY OF GREAT HEIGHT BUT WAS THICK ENOUGH TO BEAR JACK'S WEIGHT
IT IS SO COLD OUTSIDE THAT ONE'S VERY BREATH FREEZES
SO JUST CHANGE CLOTHES WITH ME AND GO UP TO THE PALACE AND THEN THE PRINCESSES WILL THINK THAT I AM COMING IN AND THE ONE WHO KISSES YOU FIRST SHALL BE YOURS AND I WILL HAVE THE OTHER FOR HE KNEW THAT THE ELDER PRINCESS WAS THE STRONGER SO HE COULD VERY WELL GUESS HOW THINGS WOULD GO
DRAGONS AND SUCH LIKE MONSTERS THAT WOULD DEVOUR US WILL NOT BE HIDDEN IN THE ROOM
BUT DEATH WAS NOT SO NEAR AS THE DOCTORS THOUGHT AND STILL HE LINGERED
BUT HARDLY HAD SHE PLUCKED THE FLOWERS WHEN HER BROTHERS WERE TURNED INTO TWELVE RAVENS WHO FLEW CROAKING OVER THE WOOD AND THE HOUSE AND GARDEN VANISHED ALSO
ONCE OUT OF THE GATE LEAVE THE FOREST BY THE OPPOSITE SIDE
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE FELT AS IF A HOT IRON WERE ENTERING HIS SOUL FOR IT FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND THAT SHE HAD DISOBEYED HIS WORD
THE TALKING HARP
AND IN FINE WEATHER SHE MAY STILL BE SEEN IN THE FIELDS WITH HER PRETTY LITTLE HOOD THE COLOUR OF THE SUN
BUT HE WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO CARRY YOUR BAG OF PROVISIONS AND YOU TOO IF YOU WALK AND RIDE BY TURNS AT LAST THEY AGREED ABOUT THE PRICE AND HALVOR LAID HIS BAG ON THE HORSE AND SOMETIMES HE WALKED AND SOMETIMES HE RODE
OH MY DEAR MUSICIAN HOW BEAUTIFULLY YOU PLAY
THERE THEY FOUND THE RATCATCHER PLAYING HIS BAGPIPES AT THE SAME SPOT AS THE EVENING BEFORE
THIS EYE ALSO MINNIKIN STOLE AND WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED AND LAMENTED AND ASKED WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER EYE MINNIKIN SAID WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME TO GET YOUR EYE BACK I WILL GIVE THEE THE ART TO BREW A HUNDRED LASTS OF MALT IN ONE BREWING SO FOR TEACHING THAT ART THE OLD HAG GOT HER EYE BACK AND THEY BOTH WENT AWAY BY DIFFERENT ROADS
IF SHE DID BUT TURN IT OVER TO SEE WHERE TO BEGIN SHE BROKE A THOUSAND THREADS AND NOT ONE COULD SHE DISENTANGLE
THERE HE DETERMINED TO GO BUT FIRST HE RODE RIGHT DOWN THE HORRIBLE TRAIL OF FAFNIR
TELL HER TO PICK OUT AND LAY IN A SEPARATE HEAP THE FEATHERS OF EACH BIRD
DOWN FLEW THE FALCON FROM THE OAK SMOTE UPON THE GROUND TURNED INTO A BRAVE YOUTH AND CRIED ALOUD
YES YES
HE TEARS THEM TO PIECES
BUT WHAT MADE THEM LAUGH ABOVE ALL WAS HIS THREAT OF GETTING HIMSELF PAID BY THEIR HEIRS
THEN ONLY WILL YOU OVERCOME ME WHEN YOU ENTER HERE THE PRINCE WENT HOME TOLD HIS FATHER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND ASKED HIM TO HAVE A LEATHER ROPE PLAITED LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO THE OTHER WORLD
OH FANFARONADE YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME THAT WAS WHEN WE WERE IN QUITE ANOTHER PLACE AND I WAS NOT HUNGRY SAID HE
TO GAIN TIME TO REMEMBER AT LEAST PART OF IT HE MADE SEVERAL LOW BOWS TO THE PRINCESS WHO ON HER SIDE DROPPED HALF-A-DOZEN CURTSEYS WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK AND THEN SAID TO RELIEVE HIS EVIDENT EMBARRASSMENT
THE KING DID ALL HE COULD BUT HE WAS UNABLE TO DESTROY IT
HOW IS IT GOOD MOTHER THAT YOU ARE SO MUCH HARDER TO PULL UP THAN THE YOUNG PRINCE
THEY THREW THEMSELVES ON THE INFURIATED KING AND HIS MINISTERS AND STUNG THEM SO FIERCELY IN THE FACE THAT THEY LOST THEIR HEADS AND NOT KNOWING WHERE TO HIDE THEMSELVES THEY ALL JUMPED PELL-MELL FROM THE WINDOW AND BROKE THEIR NECKS ON THE PAVEMENT
WHEN THEY REACHED THE BANK THEY FLUNG HER IN AND WATCHED HER SINK AFTER WHICH THEY LEFT HER
HE HAD COME TO SEE FOR HIMSELF WHY THE GOOSE HAD NEVER MADE ITS APPEARANCE
WHEN HE GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE LIGHT HAD COME FROM HE SAW A WRETCHED LITTLE COTTAGE AND THROUGH A SMALL PANE OF GLASS HE SAW A COUPLE OF OLD FOLKS INSIDE
WHATEVER DID YE COME BACK HOME FOR HOW COULD WE HELP COMING BACK
I'M HERE AND HE SAW THE DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE IMMEDIATELY THE FAWN HAD RUN IN
THIS SUDDEN ILLNESS WHICH EVERY INSTANT BECAME WORSE MADE HIM VERY UNEASY
GIVE ME A PIECE OF YOUR CAKE AND A DRAUGHT FROM YOUR BOTTLE
AT THAT SAME MOMENT THE TROLL CAME BREATHING HARD AND HE WAS EVER SO MUCH BIGGER AND STOUTER THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS AND HE TOO WAS FORCED TO GO SIDEWAYS TO GET IN THROUGH THE DOOR
BUT FIRST HE HAD TO HELP THE PRINCESS TO REMOVE THE TROLL'S BODY SO IT WAS NOT UNTIL MORNING THAT HE SET FORTH ON HIS WAY
GET UP BEHIND WITH YOU HE SAID TO THE BOY AND OFF THE HORSE WENT WITH THEM STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY BUILT A PALACE ON THE SPOT AND LIVED IN IT FOR SOME TIME
WHO'S BEEN SITTING ON MY LITTLE CHAIR THE SECOND SAID
THAT POOR OLD WOMAN CAN DO NO HARM TO ANYONE
IS MY CHILD WELL
IS MY CHILD WELL
IS MY CHILD WELL
THEN ONE DAY HE BEGGED TO HAVE LEAVE TO GO OUT WITH HIS FATHER TO FISH
BUT LUCKILY JUST AT THAT MOMENT HE STEPPED UPON A LOOSE STONE STUMBLED AND FELL FLAT ON THE GROUND WHERE HE LAY AT HIS FULL LENGTH
IF THE LADY APPEARS TO ME A THIRD TIME I WILL DO AS SHE TELLS ME THE FOLLOWING DAY TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF ALL THE VILLAGE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON A VOICE WAS HEARD SINGING
BROTHER AND SISTER BROTHER TOOK SISTER BY THE HAND AND SAID
I CAN'T BREATHE LIFE INTO YOU AGAIN SO ON HE WENT WITH HIS OX
THERE SHE SANG AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY LITTLE BRIGHT-EYES LITTLE REDSKIN COME NURSE THE CHILD YOU BORE
THE PRINCE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND ASKED LEAVE TO REST
THE PRINCESS WAS SO REJOICED TO BE FREE THAT SHE DANCED AND SANG BUT THEN SHE REMEMBERED HER SISTERS AND SAID
SO HE PUT BACK THE BOX AND LOCKED THE CABINET UP AGAIN AND HAVING REPLACED THE KEY IN THE CRACK IN THE WALL HASTENED DOWN TO THE GALLERY
IF YOU DON'T TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE MARES IF YOU LOSE MERELY ONE OF THEM--YOUR BOLD HEAD WILL BE STUCK ON THAT POLE HE DROVE THE MARES AFIELD
I WON'T COME DO YOU HEAR
THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT THROUGH ALL THE VILLAGE AND ON THE TOP OF THE HILL THE PEOPLE STOOD HOLDING THEIR SIDES WITH LAUGHING AS THEY WATCHED THE STAR GAZER TRUDGING BRAVELY ALONG THE VALLEY WITH HIS BUNDLE AT THE END OF HIS STICK
ONE DAY THE KING WENT OUT WALKING WITH MINNIKIN AND MINNIKIN ASKED HIM IF HE HAD NEVER HAD ANY OTHER CHILDREN
SHALL I THEN RECEIVE NOTHING AT ALL OF MY INHERITANCE ASKED THE YOUTH
THIS IS ONE OF THE NICEST THINGS I TOOK FROM THE KNIGHT SAID THE GIANT
MIRROR MIRROR HANGING THERE WHO IN ALL THE LAND'S MOST FAIR AND THE MIRROR ANSWERED AS BEFORE
SO THE YOUTH SET OFF TAKING WITH HIM A PRETTY SHOE WITH A SILVER BUCKLE THAT WAS LYING ABOUT IN THE HOUSE
SHE WAS SO GRACEFUL AND PRETTY AND CLEVER THAT SHE WAS CALLED GRACIOSA AND THE QUEEN WAS SO FOND OF HER THAT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE
BUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO STOP HER AND REPRESENTED THAT HER HIGH RANK MADE IT PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD DO ANY SUCH THING SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN AND ORDERED THEM TO BE SILENT
A YELLOW WIFE
SHE SHALL BE THE PRETTIEST GIRL THAT EVER WAS AND FAIR AND BRIGHT AS THE DAY SAID THE FIRST HEAD
SO THEY CELEBRATED THE WEDDING WITH GREAT REJOICINGS
IT WAS THE LITTLE FIRE-COLOURED HOOD THAT HAD BURNT HIS TONGUE RIGHT DOWN HIS THROAT
SHE WALKED ALL DAY LONG AND CAME IN THE EVENING TO THE LITTLE ENCHANTED HOUSE
THE NEXT MORNING CAME THE GAOLER WITH THE QUEEN'S ALLOWANCE OF THREE PEAS WHICH HE BROUGHT IN UPON A LARGE DISH TO MAKE THEM LOOK SMALLER
THEY ONLY JUST MANAGED TO LIVE FROM HAND TO MOUTH AND HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN DOING EVEN SO MUCH AS THAT BUT THEY HAD THREE SONS AND THE YOUNGEST OF THEM WAS CALLED CINDERLAD FOR HE DID NOTHING ELSE BUT LIE AND POKE ABOUT AMONG THE ASHES
WE'LL MANAGE TO ESCAPE SOMEHOW AND WILL FLY FOR OUR LIVES YES REPLIED HIS MOTHER THAT IS WHAT YOU MUST DO--GO WITH YOUR ELEVEN BROTHERS OUT INTO THE WOOD AND LET ONE OF YOU ALWAYS SIT ON THE HIGHEST TREE YOU CAN FIND KEEPING WATCH ON THE TOWER OF THE CASTLE
AND INDEED IT WAS BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME THAT SHE CAME WITH HER FOUR FAIRIES AND AS SHE FITTED THE THREE KEYS INTO THE LOCKS SHE SAID
HOWEVER AS SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS SHE LIVED IN HOPE OF SOON GOING BACK TO HER OWN COUNTRY AND TRIED TO AMUSE HERSELF AS WELL AS SHE COULD UNTIL THE TIME SHOULD COME
AND HALVOR HAD A FANCY FOR THAT SO HE WAS NOT LONG IN GETTING READY
NAY SAID HE NEVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE HAVE I SEEN SUCH A MAN AND SUCH A HORSE AND WHEN THE YOUTH INQUIRED IF HE COULD HAVE A PLACE IN THE KING'S PALACE THE KING WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT HE COULD HAVE DANCED ON THE STEPS WHERE HE WAS STANDING AND THERE AND THEN THE LAD WAS TOLD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A PLACE
HE WAS STILL WATCHING HER ADMIRINGLY WHEN THE PRINCESS OPENED HER EYES AND AS SHE ALSO RECOGNISED HIM THEY WERE SOON GREAT FRIENDS
INSTEAD OF CHATTING WITH THEM IN THE DUSK HE WANDERED ABOUT THE WOODS WHISPERING TO THE MOON
WHEN SHE WENT CLATTERING UP THE STAIRS AGAIN OUT CAME THE PRINCE AND TOOK THE COMB AND FLUNG IT AT HER AND ORDERED HER TO BE OFF AS FAST AS SHE COULD
BUT WHAT A WORTHLESS SET OF FELLOWS YOU MUST BE TO SIT HERE AND LET THE MASTER THIEF STEAL THE HORSES FROM UNDER YOU AND THEY ALL GOT A BEATING FOR NOT HAVING KEPT WATCH BETTER
THERE THERE DON'T BE MELANCHOLY SAID THE FAIRY
WHO IS THERE SAYS THE WOLF SOFTENING HIS ROUGH VOICE AS BEST HE CAN
WILL YOU STAY AND KEEP HOUSE FOR US COOK MAKE THE BEDS THE WASHING SEW AND KNIT
SO THEY SAILED ONWARDS A LONG WAY FARTHER
REALLY SAID THE FAIRY DOUCELINE ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION I CANNOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE THREE STROKES OF HER WAND UPON THE GOLDEN BRANCH AND IMMEDIATELY ALL THE PRISONERS IN THE ENCHANTER'S CASTLE FOUND THEMSELVES FREE AND CAME WITH ALL SPEED TO THE WONDERFUL GARDEN WHERE ONE TOUCH OF THE GOLDEN BRANCH RESTORED EACH ONE TO HIS NATURAL FORM AND THEY GREETED ONE ANOTHER WITH MANY REJOICINGS
I AM VERY FOND OF MUSIC AND MY HARP IS A FAITHFUL SERVANT SO HE DREW THE HARP TOWARDS HIM AND SAID
BUT THAT WILL BE NO EASY THING TO DO SAID HE FOR YOUR EQUAL IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE WORLD OH YES THERE IS ONE TO MATCH ME SAID DAPPLEGRIM
BUT THE YOUNG MAN GREW WEARY
THERE HE LANDED AND WHEN HE HAD WALKED ON FOR SOME DISTANCE HE MET AN OLD MAN WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD
HE VERY SOON FOUND THAT SQUIRREL ISLAND WAS UNINHABITED
WHEN SIGURD HEARD THE STORY HE SAID TO REGIN
BUT WHEN YOU GET THERE PLACE YOURSELF ON THE STAIRS BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR AND THEN I WILL COME BLUSTERING IN AS IF I WANTED TO BLOW DOWN THE WHOLE CASTLE AND WHEN THE PRINCE WHO IS TO HAVE YOUR QUEEN COMES OUT TO SEE WHAT IS ASTIR JUST TAKE HIM BY THE THROAT AND FLING HIM OUT AND THEN I WILL TRY TO CARRY HIM AWAY FROM COURT AS THE NORTH WIND HAD SAID SO DID THE KING
THE HANGINGS WERE ALL OF BATS WINGS AND FROM THE CEILING HUNG TWELVE CATS WHO FILLED THE HALL WITH THEIR EAR PIERCING YELLS
ALL THIS MIGHTY HOST HAS BEEN SLAIN BY THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA PRINCE IVAN RODE FURTHER ON AND CAME TO A WHITE TENT AND FORTH CAME TO MEET HIM THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA
SO THEY HAD NEITHER FOOD TO EAT NOR WOOD TO BURN
NO THERE IS NO ONE WHO CAN DO IT SAID THE TROLL
I AM PRINCE PERCINET OF WHOSE RICHES YOU MAY HAVE HEARD AND WHOSE FAIRY GIFT WILL I HOPE BE OF USE TO YOU IN ALL YOUR DIFFICULTIES IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU UNDER THIS DISGUISE AH PERCINET CRIED THE PRINCESS IS IT REALLY YOU
I WON'T COME THE BARBER AND THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE SHOP LISTENED TO HIM WITH AMAZEMENT
ANYHOW LEAVE YOUR SILVER SNUFF-BOX WITH US
IF A MAN SHOULD COME WHO WANTS TO BUY ME SAID JACK YOU ARE TO TELL HIM THAT YOU WANT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THAT HE WILL GIVE AND TREAT YOU BESIDES
SLEEP A WHILE NOW ON MY LAP SAID SHE AND WHILE HE LAY THERE SHE PUT A GARMENT OF BRASS UPON HIM
THE BARLEYCORNS FLEW INTO THE POT AND THE HEARTH WAS CLEAN
BUT HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF A CERTAIN TAILOR AND ENGAGED HIMSELF AS HIS SERVANT
HE HAS GIVEN ME AS MUCH AS I WANT
THEY TOOK CARE BEFOREHAND TO MAKE A BLAZING HOT FIRE UNDER THE BATH SO THAT THE LOVELY YOUNG QUEEN MIGHT BE SUFFOCATED
I AM AFTER THAT STEED MYSELF THESE SEVEN YEARS AND CAN NEVER STEAL HIM ON ACCOUNT OF A SILK COVERING HE HAS ON HIM IN THE STABLE WITH SIXTY BELLS FIXED TO IT AND WHENEVER YOU APPROACH THE PLACE HE QUICKLY OBSERVES IT AND SHAKES HIMSELF
SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE WHOLE PALACE WAS CROWDED WITH NURSES WHO CAME FROM THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD TO OFFER THEMSELVES UNTIL THE QUEEN DECLARED THAT IF SHE WAS EVER TO SEE THE HALF OF THEM THEY MUST BE BROUGHT OUT TO HER ONE BY ONE AS SHE SAT IN A SHADY WOOD NEAR THE PALACE
WHEN HE HAD EATEN IT ALL UP HE SAID
PERHAPS NOW IN MY HOUR OF NEED THEY MAY BE OF USE TO ME SO SHE TOOK THE BONES OUT OF HER BUNDLE AND HAVING THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT SHE PLACED THE TWO ENDS TOGETHER
NOW SIR KNIGHT SAYS THE THIEF OF SLOAN YOU SEE WHAT DANGERS I CAME THROUGH AND ALWAYS ESCAPED
IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER THE MASTER THIEF TOOK THE JOINT AND RAN OFF WITH IT AND WHETHER THE GOVERNOR GOT ANY ROAST MEAT FOR HIS DINNER THAT DAY I KNOW NOT BUT I KNOW THAT HE HAD NO ROAST HARE THOUGH HE CHASED IT TILL HE WAS BOTH HOT AND TIRED
IF I HAD BUT THE FELLOW TO IT I WOULD CARRY IT HOME WITH ME AND THEN I SHOULD PUT MY OLD WOMAN INTO A GOOD HUMOUR FOR ONCE FOR HE HAD A WIFE WHO WAS SO CROSS AND ILL-TEMPERED THAT THE TIME BETWEEN THE BEATINGS SHE GAVE HIM WAS VERY SHORT
HE OPENED ONE AFTER ANOTHER UNTIL AT LAST HE CAME TO ONE TINY DRAWER WHICH CONTAINED ONLY AN EMERALD KEY
THE FAIRY WAS SO TOUCHED BY THE SIGHT OF HER MISERY THAT WHEN SHE KISSED HER HAND SHE WHISPERED
BUT THEN IF HE ISN'T HE'LL NEVER GIVE US THESE BEAUTIES AS WIVES SO WHEN THEY HAD AGREED ON THIS THEY LOWERED THE ROPE
BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE SUN WAS DARKENED THE EARTH TREMBLED AND DESIRE HEARD A VOICE CRYING
WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO GIVE YOU BACK YOUR HUMAN FORM AGAIN ALACK-A-DAY
IN THE MEANTIME THE PRINCE WAS KEPT SAFELY LOCKED UP IN HIS TOWER AND THAT HE MIGHT BE AS DULL AS POSSIBLE KING GRUMPY ORDERED THAT NO ONE SHOULD SPEAK TO HIM AND THAT THEY SHOULD GIVE HIM NEXT TO NOTHING TO EAT
THEN BRYNHILD SAW THE RING WHICH SIGARD HAD GIVEN TO GUDRUN AND SHE KNEW IT AND KNEW ALL AND SHE TURNED AS PALE AS A DEAD WOMAN AND WENT HOME
MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GET INTO MY THROAT--GO INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS MY FRIEND LADDER AND NIMBLE BAG AND BAGGAGE GOES TO KEEP COMPANY WITH FRIEND FOX
I AM PURSUED BY RATS THE PRINCE WHEN HE HEARD THIS GOT UP ALSO AND RAN AFTER THE KING AND THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN THEY BOTH FELL INTO THE RIVER AND WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN
BUT YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL HOW YOU MAKE MY BED--YOU MUST SHAKE IT WELL TILL THE FEATHERS FLY
THE FATHER SAID NO
THE POOR BOY WAS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED AS I AM SURE YOU AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HIS PLACE
THEN HE GOT BACK INTO THE CARRIAGE AND TOLD HIS WIFE TO KISS HIM
WHEN THE BLESSING WAS GIVEN THEY WENT HOME AGAIN AND AFTER THAT I SAW NO MORE OF THEM.(28 28 FROM J
IF YOU HAVE NOT PICKED THE BARLEY OUT OF THE ASHES AND PUT IT ALL BACK IN THE POT BEFORE NIGHTFALL I SHALL EAT YOU UP THEN SHE HASTENED AFTER THE OTHERS AND THE POOR GIRL STAYED AT HOME AND WEPT
BURCHARD HAD EVERY NETTLE ROOTED UP FOR THREE LEAGUES ROUND
ALL THE COURTIERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN DISMAY AND THE KING WAS TERRIBLY CROSS
AH HE SAID TO HIMSELF
AFTER A YEAR THE KING MARRIED AGAIN
NOW GO OVER FRESH WATER AND SALT WATER OVER HILL AND DALE AND DO NOT STOP UNTIL THOU COMEST TO WHERE THE KING'S DAUGHTER IS SAID MINNIKIN TO THE SHIP AND OFF IT WENT IN A MOMENT OVER LAND AND WATER TILL THE WIND WHISTLED AND MOANED ALL ROUND ABOUT IT
LOOK HERE OLD MAN WE MUST REALLY KILL THAT SHEEP LEST IT RUN AWAY TO THE WOOD AGAIN THE MAN WHO WAS A PEACEABLE QUIET SORT OF FELLOW MADE NO OBJECTIONS BUT SIMPLY SAID
HAS THE COUNT GIVEN HIS CONSENT TO OUR MARRIAGE NO SAID RENELDE
I NEVER WILL MARRY YOU I YOU ARE TOO UGLY AND TOO MUCH LIKE YOUR CRUEL FATHER
THEN HE PUT HIS FINGER IN HIS MOUTH AND SO TASTED THE HEART OF FAFNIR
HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME MAN AS STRAIGHT AS A FIR TREE
FOR SHE THOUGHT HE IS YOUNG AND HANDSOME AND I'LL CERTAINLY BE HAPPIER WITH HIM THAN WITH THE OLD WITCH SO SHE PUT HER HAND IN HIS AND SAID
YOU SHALL TAKE THIS GOOD PIECE OF CAKE TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER FOR A SUNDAY TREAT TO-MORROW
DO GIVE ME A PIECE OF THAT CAKE YOU HAVE GOT IN YOUR POCKET AND LET ME HAVE A DRAUGHT OF YOUR WINE--I AM SO HUNGRY AND THIRSTY BUT THIS CLEVER SON REPLIED
TAKE ME WITH THEE DRAKESTAIL SAID TO HIMSELF ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS
HE DRANK IT UP AND ASKED FOR MORE SAYING
NO HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER HE SAID
HERE ALL HAPPENED JUST AS IT HAD HAPPENED IN THE COPPER WOOD AND SILVER WOOD
THEN THE KING SUMMONED HIS COUNSELLORS AND HIS GUARDS AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE QUEEN WENT INTO HIS GREAT HALL
THE QUEEN PUT HER ROYAL MANTLE OVER HER HEAD AND ALL THE PRINCESSES DID THE SAME WITH THEIR TRAINS
HE WENT DOWN INTO THE STABLE AND VERY SAD AND FULL OF CARE HE WAS
YOU HAVE CALLED YOURSELVES KING AND PRINCE HE CRIED TO TRY AND MAKE ME MARRY YOUR SISTER BUT YOU ARE NOTHING BUT BEGGARS NOT WORTH THE WATER YOU DRINK
THE WITCH INTERFERED OF COURSE BUT THE PRINCE SAID
AH SCOUNDREL
WITH A TREMENDOUS ROAR HE SPRANG FROM HIS SEAT AND IN TWO STRIDES HAD REACHED THE DOOR
A LITTLE FARTHER ON HE MEETS COMRADE WASP'S-NEST MANOEUVRING HIS WASPS
GIVE US SOME CRIED THE DWARFS
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED THE MAN'S DAUGHTER
EVER SINCE HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE BOY HE HAD BEEN UNWILLING TO DO ANY WORK AND HAD JUST SAT RAKING ABOUT AMONG THE ASHES
NOW I BEG ONE LAST FAVOUR OF YOU
ANOTHER PEACOCK WAS SENT TO THE ADMIRAL TO TELL HIM THAT HE COULD NOW LAND IN PERFECT SAFETY WHICH HE AT ONCE DID BRINGING ALL HIS MEN WITH HIM EVEN TO JACK-THE-CHATTERER WHO HAPPENING TO PASS THE SPIT UPON WHICH THE ADMIRAL'S DINNER WAS ROASTING SNATCHED IT UP AND BROUGHT IT WITH HIM
I HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO GET THE HEARTH CLEAN NOW THE PRINCE HAD KEPT ALL THE THINGS THE GIRL HAD LOST AND HE SOON SET ABOUT FINDING THE OWNER OF THEM
NOW YOU LOOK AS YOU OUGHT TO LOOK DELICIA
HER HEART WAS CHEERED BY THE SIGHT OF THE FLOWERS AND THE SOFT COOL GRASS AND SHE SAT DOWN AND RESTED FOR A LITTLE
IN THE GOOD MAN'S HOUSE TOO PREPARATIONS WERE MADE TO GO TO THE PALACE
THE FIRST SAID
THE FIRST SAID
THE FIRST SAID
MEANWHILE THE DUCHESS GRUMBLY WAS ALSO OCCUPIED IN ATTIRING HERSELF
SHE PASSED THROUGH WOODS WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN TRODDEN BY HUMAN FOOT AND HAD TO CROSS FIELDS OF ICE AND AVALANCHES OF SNOW
THEN HER MOTHER BADE HER BATHE ON ONE SIDE OF THE STEM DRY HERSELF ON ANOTHER AND DRESS ON THE THIRD
THE OLD NURSE DIED LEAVING HER COTTAGE AND THE FEW ARTICLES OF FURNITURE IT CONTAINED TO HER POOR LADY WHO DWELT IN IT WORKING AS A PEASANT FOR HER DAILY BREAD
AT LAST SHE COULD ENDURE SNOWDROP'S PRESENCE NO LONGER AND CALLING A HUNTSMAN TO HER SHE SAID
OBEY HIM AND DO EVERYTHING THAT HE WISHES AND I FEEL SURE THAT HEAVEN WILL SHORTLY SEND YOU RELEASE IF YOU WISH ME TO DO THIS DEAR FATHER I WILL DO IT REPLIED THE GIRL
FOR SHE WAS REALLY UGLY ENOUGH TO HAVE FRIGHTENED ANYBODY
WHEN HE HEARD FRISK'S BARKING HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
GO YOU ON IN FRONT OLD MAN WITH OUR YOUNGEST
THE SAME EVENING THE TWELVE SISTERS WENT AGAIN TO THE BALL AND THE STAR GAZER AGAIN FOLLOWED THEM AND CROSSED THE LAKE IN LINA'S BOAT
WE WILL JUDGE HER CAUSE AT ONCE AND HE SEATED HIMSELF SOLEMNLY ON THE OVEN AND CONDEMNED TITTY TO BE BURNED ALIVE
FOR SHAME YOU BOLD GIRLS
PRESENTLY THE CHILDREN FOUND A LITTLE BROOK DANCING AND GLITTERING OVER THE STONES AND BROTHER WAS EAGER TO DRINK OF IT BUT AS IT RUSHED PAST SISTER HEARD IT MURMURING
SIDE BY SIDE AGAINST THE WALL THERE WERE SEVEN LITTLE BEDS COVERED WITH SNOW-WHITE COUNTERPANES
BUT HIS PRIME MINISTER DECLARED THAT IT WOULD NEVER DO TO LET SUCH A TRICK AS THAT PASS UNPUNISHED EVERYBODY WOULD LAUGH AT HIM
FOR A BETTER WOMAN THAN THE QUEEN TO RICH AND POOR WAS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE WORLD
IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE CIRCLET AND THE SHOES OF GOLD
WHILE JACK WAS STANDING LOOKING AT THE CASTLE A VERY STRANGE-LOOKING WOMAN CAME OUT OF THE WOOD AND ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM
SO THE EAGLE FLEW ON A LONG LONG WAY BUT THEN IT GREW TIRED AND SAT DOWN ON A FIR TREE
AND THE HARP PLAYED A SWEET LULLABY TO THE SOUND OF WHICH ITS MASTER FELL ASLEEP
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE GARDEN BOY HAD JUST BEEN SENT AWAY AND THOUGH THE STAR GAZER DID NOT LOOK VERY STURDY THE GARDENER AGREED TO TAKE HIM AS HE THOUGHT THAT HIS PRETTY FACE AND GOLDEN CURLS WOULD PLEASE THE PRINCESSES
NOT WISHING HOWEVER TO CUT A POOR FIGURE AT THE BALL BY THE SIDE OF THE OTHER DANCERS HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE LAURELS AND SAID
THE GIANT CAME IN TO SUPPER
IN ORDER TO DO HER MORE HONOUR TUBBY CAME TO MEET HER AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT MARBLE STAIRCASE
WAIT THERE TILL I RETURN SAID THE MUSICIAN AND WENT ON HIS WAY
EVERYBODY WAS SORRY ROSETTE ESPECIALLY AND ALL THE BELLS IN THE KINGDOM WERE TOLLED
AT THIS JUNCTURE THE GUARDS WHO WERE IN GREAT FEAR THAT THEY WOULD BE FOUND OUT SENT TO TELL THE KING THAT HIS SON WAS DEAD WHICH ANNOYED HIM VERY MUCH
AFTERWARDS THEY ALL THREE MET BROKE OPEN THE BARREL TOOK OUT THE REMAINS OF PRINCE IVAN WASHED THEM AND PUT THEM TOGETHER IN FITTING ORDER
NOW WE ARE RUINED INDEED FOR THAT WAS NO OTHER THAN THE FAIRY CARABOSSE WHO HAS HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ME EVER SINCE I WAS A BOY AND PUT SULPHUR INTO HER PORRIDGE ONE DAY FOR FUN THEN THE QUEEN BEGAN TO CRY
BUT HE SOON SAW THAT HE COULDN'T CATCH IT ON FOOT SO HE HASTENED TO THE STABLE LAID HIS HANDS ON THE BEST HORSE THERE AND SET OFF IN PURSUIT
LONG AGO TOO SHE HAD VOWED NEVER TO MARRY A MAN WHO KNEW FEAR AND DARED NOT RIDE THROUGH THE FENCE OF FLAMING FIRE
THREE DAYS LATER THE COUNT AGAIN PASSED BY
THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS MADE AMPLE AMENDS TO THE KING AND PRINCE FOR THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TREATED AND DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO SHOW HOW SORRY HE WAS
BUT AT NIGHTFALL IT HAD TO FOLLOW THE HERD AND SAID TO THE WIDOW WOMAN
MAKE ME A GOOD SWORD THAT I MAY KILL THIS DRAGON SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
EVERY DAY SHE HAD TO SIT BY A WELL ON THE HIGH ROAD AND SPIN TILL HER FINGERS WERE SO SORE THAT THEY OFTEN BLED
THE SIX SILLIES ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A YOUNG GIRL WHO REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTY-SEVEN WITHOUT EVER HAVING HAD A LOVER FOR SHE WAS SO FOOLISH THAT NO ONE WANTED TO MARRY HER
YOU MUST FIRST GIVE SOME MORE SAMPLES OF YOUR SKILL SAID THE GOVERNOR TRYING TO SPEAK HIM FAIR FOR WHAT YOU DID TO-DAY WAS NO SUCH VERY GREAT THING AFTER ALL
AFTER THAT THE PRINCE WENT TO CHURCH AND KARI ALSO BEGGED FOR LEAVE TO GO
THE GIRL SPRANG INTO THE SADDLE AND RODE AS SWIFT AS AN ARROW TO THE PALACE
AH PERCINET
THE RATS WILL BE PAID ONE GROS A HEAD AS YOU ASK THE BAGPIPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPERATE THAT VERY EVENING WHEN THE MOON ROSE
DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW ASKED THE FOAL
BUT HIS COURTIERS SAID THAT SEEMED A PITY FOR WHEN THE BABY GREW UP SHE WOULD BE A VERY NICE WIFE FOR THE KING'S ONLY SON
O BRAVE FELLOW I NOT ONLY PARDON YOU ALL BUT WILL KEEP YOU WITH MYSELF WHILE YOU LIVE WHERE YOU SHALL FEAST LIKE PRINCES AND HAVE EVERY ATTENDANCE THAT I HAVE MYSELF THEY ALL RETURNED THANKS ON THEIR KNEES AND THE BLACK THIEF TOLD HIM THE REASON THEY ATTEMPTED TO STEAL THE STEED OF BELLS AND THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER IN GOING HOME
OPEN THE DOOR CRIED THE KING BUT THE YOUTH DID NOT HEAR
HE TURNED AS AT FIRST HIS BACK TO THE CHURCH AND THE MOMENT THE MOON ROSE ON THE HORIZON TRARIRA TRARI THE BAGPIPES RESOUNDED
AFTER SOME LITTLE TIME HAD ELAPSED THE QUEEN SPOKE ONE NIGHT AND SAID
DO YOU SEE NOTHING NOW SAID THE BULL
SO SHE WENT OVER THE SEVEN HILLS TILL SHE REACHED THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN DWARFS AND KNOCKING AT THE DOOR SHE CALLED OUT
WELL IT'S OF NO USE TO BE ANGRY ABOUT IT SAID THE PRINCESS FOR I CAN'T GET IT OFF
THEY ARE ALL THERE REPLIED FRIEND BLANCHET
MIRROR MIRROR HANGING THERE WHO IN ALL THE LAND'S MOST FAIR AND THE MIRROR REPLIED
AT FIRST RAPUNZEL WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED WHEN A MAN CAME IN FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE
BUT NOW SAID SHE YOU MUST FIRST HELP ME TO GET THIS DEAD BODY AWAY FROM HERE HALVOR WAS SO STRONG THAT HE CLEARED EVERYTHING AWAY AND MADE ALL CLEAN AND TIDY VERY QUICKLY
SHE THUS ADDRESSED HIM
WE WILL LOOK AT IT AND REMEMBER YOU HE LEFT A SILVER FORK BEHIND AND WENT HIS WAY
WHEN SHE HAD DONE THIS SHE LED THE ROE FARTHER AND FARTHER RIGHT INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST
YES HE IS THE RIGHT ONE CRIED THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
HE HAD CURLY GOLDEN HAIR AND WAS VERY PALE AND HE WORE A CROWN OF PEACOCKS FEATHERS
RISE UP PRINCESS OLGA
IF THE KING IS KILLED WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME AND OF MY LITTLE DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS SO SORROWFUL THAT SHE COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SLEEP
HE PALED WITH ANGER AND HIS EYES FLASHED FIRE
THEY ALL LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN BECAUSE HE WAS SO STUPID FEELING SURE HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING
YOU ARE A GREAT PRINCESS ACCUSTOMED TO FARE DAINTILY AND I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU BUT BLACK BREAD AND RADISHES WHICH WILL NOT SUIT YOU AT ALL
LET US HAVE DONE WITH IT SAID GUILBERT
SO A GREAT FIRE WAS LIT IN THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WHERE SHE WAS TO BE BURNT AND THE KING WATCHED THE PROCEEDINGS FROM AN UPPER WINDOW CRYING BITTERLY THE WHILE FOR HE STILL LOVED HIS WIFE DEARLY
JUMPED DOWN FROM THE TREE RAN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE WOOD AND AGAIN HANGED HIMSELF IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BEFORE HIM
AND SHE LAID ANOTHER
WHITHER DOES GOD SEND YOU
HE CARRIED A PORTRAIT ENCLOSED IN A BOW ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS AND HE DECLARED HIMSELF WILLING TO MAINTAIN AGAINST THEM ALL THAT THE QUEEN WAS THE UGLIEST CREATURE IN THE WORLD AND THAT THE PRINCESS WHOSE PORTRAIT HE CARRIED WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU WANT HERE SAID ONE OF THEM TO THE OLD WOMAN
IF YOU DON'T BRING ME SOMETHING TO EAT I WILL HAVE ALL YOUR HEADS CUT OFF THEN THEY WHISPERED ONE TO ANOTHER
SCARCELY HAD THEY BEEN TORN FROM THE SOIL WHEN THEY SOWED THEMSELVES AFRESH AND GREW AS YOU WERE LOOKING AT THEM
THEN HE THOUGHT HE MUST TRY AND GET TO IT AND AFTER A LONG LONG TIME HE DID REACH IT
SO THE HORSE STOOD THERE STAMPING AND KICKING AND SNORTING AND REARING AND OUT CAME A GIRL WHO THOUGHT IT A SIN AND A SHAME TO TREAT A HORSE SO ILL
THERE REMAINED ACROSS THE RIVER A THIN EVER SO THIN A BRIDGE
AND WHEN HE WAS RID OF HIM THE KING WENT INTO THE CASTLE
NOW YOU SHALL SEE ONE OF MY BLOWS THEN HE GRASPED HIS SWORD AND STRUCK AT THE TROLL SO THAT ALL HIS TEN HEADS DANCED AWAY OVER THE SANDS
AT NIGHT WHEN ALL THE OTHERS HAD GONE TO BED THE KING'S DAUGHTER STOLE SOFTLY DOWN TO THE BYRE TO THE BULL AND HE TOOK HER ON HIS BACK AND GOT OUT OF THE COURTYARD AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
THERE THEY RECEIVED ALL SORTS OF TREASURES AND RICHES THREE SACKS FULL OF GOLD AND AS MUCH SILVER AND A SPLENDID STEED WHICH BORE THEM HOME TO THE PALACE
AND THIS IS WHY TO-DAY THE COUNTRY BOYS ALWAYS THROW STONES AT A TITMOUSE
HERE YOU ARE AT THE SUMMIT OF YOUR WISHES
DON'T FORGET THERE IS TO BE A CHRISTENING TO-DAY AND HE RAN AFTER HIM CAUGHT HIM BY THE SLEEVE AND HUNG ON TO IT HIMSELF
TELL YOUR SLAVE SAID HE TO CARRY THIS WHEREVER YOU PLEASE BUT ON NO ACCOUNT TO OPEN IT
AND HOW WILL OUR FATHER EVER FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE GONE IN WHILE THEY WERE SPEAKING THUS ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER THEY HAD REACHED THE ROOM
SOME TIME OR OTHER I'LL DO YOU A GOOD TURN VERY WELL
HE RODE STRAIGHT UP TO HIM AND ASKED IF HE HAD SEEN ANYONE HIDING ANYWHERE ABOUT IN A WOOD THAT WAS CLOSE BY
HERE I AM PRINCESS AS MUCH AS EVER AT YOUR SERVICE SAID HE THOUGH REALLY YOU ARE NOT VERY KIND TO ME THEN HE JUST STROKED THE SKEIN WITH HIS WAND AND ALL THE BROKEN THREADS JOINED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND THE WHOLE SKEIN WOUND ITSELF SMOOTHLY OFF IN THE MOST SURPRISING MANNER AND THE PRINCE TURNING TO GRACIOSA ASKED IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO DO FOR HER AND IF THE TIME WOULD NEVER COME WHEN SHE WOULD WISH FOR HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE
WELL WE MUST LEARN TO CATCH THE DEVIL IN HIS OWN SNARES
I AM QUITE READY TO HELP YOU AND DO ALL I CAN TO SERVE YOU MADAM HE SAID ONLY I BEG YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO HIDE ME FROM YOUR HUSBAND FOR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO BE EATEN AT ALL THAT'S A GOOD BOY SAID THE GIANTESS NODDING HER HEAD
EVEN THEN SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED AND WAS STILL GRUMBLING AND MUTTERING SO THEY ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WHEN THEY CAME IN AGAIN THEY WERE SO SHAMEFACED THAT THEY HARDLY DARED TO LOOK AT HALVOR TOWARDS WHOM THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO PROUD AND HAUGHTY BEFORE
UPON WHICH SHE MUTTERED SOMETHING AND PASSED ON BUT HID HERSELF IN A HOLLOW TREE FROM WHICH SHE COULD SEE ALL THAT HAPPENED
THEN THE SECOND HEAD APPEARED
YOU SHALL CLEAN THE KNIVES AND BLACK THE BOOTS AND MAKE THE FIRES AND HELP ME GENERALLY WHEN THE GIANT IS OUT
I AM BENJAMIN YOUR YOUNGEST BROTHER SO THEY WEPT FOR JOY AND KISSED AND HUGGED EACH OTHER AGAIN AND AGAIN
THEN THE STEPMOTHER WAS MORE FURIOUS THAN EVER AND DID NOTHING BUT PLOT MISCHIEF AGAINST THE MAN'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS DAILY GROWING MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL
I WILL BURY HIM BETTER AFTERWARDS BUT JUST LET ME HAVE THE SHEET TO WIPE MYSELF WITH FOR HE WAS BLEEDING AND I HAVE GOT COVERED WITH BLOOD WITH CARRYING HIM SO SHE GAVE HIM THE SHEET
WHEN THE YOUTH RETURNED TO THE PALACE THE KING WAS BOTH HAPPY AND DELIGHTED TO GET HIS DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN AS MAY EASILY BE BELIEVED BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE COURT HAD SO WORKED ON HIM THAT HE WAS ANGRY WITH THE LAD TOO
AT FIRST THE DUCHESS CLUNG TO THE SADDLE BUT SHE WAS VERY SOON THROWN OFF AND FELL IN A HEAP AMONG THE STONES AND THORNS AND THERE THEY FOUND HER SHAKEN TO A JELLY AND COLLECTED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A BROKEN GLASS
NOW HE SAID THE YOUNGEST OF THEM HAS COME HOME AND HAS THREATENED ME TILL I HAVE COME TO YOU TO ASK FOR YOUR DAUGHTER FOR HIM AND I AM TO SAY THAT HE IS A MASTER THIEF AND AGAIN THE MAN FELL A-WEEPING AND LAMENTING
THEN HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE THIRD LOAF ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE AND PUT THE KNIFE TO IT AS IF HE MEANT TO CUT IT STRAIGHT IN TWO
BUT ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY HE SAW A LIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE TREES
BUT WHEN THE KING ASKED THE YOUTH
LET ME STAY HERE TO-NIGHT
HE WAS SO CHARMING THAT DELICIA LOVED HIM FROM THE MOMENT THEIR EYES MET AND AS FOR HIM OF COURSE HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING HIMSELF THE LUCKIEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD
SO ALL THE WAITING-MAIDS AND ALL THE WOMENKIND IN THE CASTLE HAD TO COME AND TRY ON THE SHOE BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE WHOM IT WOULD FIT
THEN HE STANDS UP ON END PUTS HIS TWO FORE-PAWS ON THE LATCH AND THE DOOR OPENS
WHAT HE CRIED HAVE THE TWO RASCALS WHO ARE MY PRISONERS DARED TO PLAY ME SUCH A TRICK AS THIS
I WILL SAYS HE BUT YOU WHO SLEEP WHILE YOU WALK WILL SOON BE TIRED
SHE TAKES BAG AND BAGGAGE AND GLOU GLOU GLOU SHE TAKES HER PLACE BETWEEN FRIEND FOX AND MY FRIEND LADDER
COULD I BE HE SAID HALVOR
SO THE YOUTH WENT UP TO THE KITCHEN AND BEGAN TO SHARPEN THE LARGEST BREAD-KNIFE THAT HE COULD FIND
RALEO RALEO HOW THE CATTLE GO IT WAS THE LITTLE COW-BOY DRIVING HIS HERD BACK TO THE BYRE
AND HOP
AFTER THAT I MUST WANDER WITH THE HERD FAR AWAY TO OTHER LANDS THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE WIDOW WOMAN WENT BACK TO THE CASTLE TO FETCH THE CHILD
THESE TWO THINGS WERE ALL THAT SHE HAD INHERITED FROM HER MOTHER
AND NOW IT WAS HIS TURN TO GO AND HIDE HIMSELF
HE DRANK THEIR HEALTH AND THEN SLIPPED THE RING WHICH THE PRINCESS HAD PUT ON HIS FINGER WHEN THEY WERE SITTING BY THE WATERSIDE INTO THE GLASS AND ORDERED THE CUP-BEARER TO CARRY THE GLASS TO THE BRIDE FROM HIM AND GREET HER
THERE WAS NO MISTAKING IT AND THE QUEEN AND PERCINET WERE COMING TO MEET HER
SO WHEN THE PRIEST RETURNED HOME IN THE EVENING THE YOUTH BEGAN TO CRY FATHER LAWRENCE
WHEN THE MAN CAME UP HE AT ONCE SAW THE SHOE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THERE STOOD A LITTLE TABLE COVERED WITH A WHITE TABLECLOTH AND SEVEN LITTLE PLATES AND FORKS AND SPOONS AND KNIVES AND TUMBLERS
SECONDLY IT WAS NOT SHE NOR THE GOOD GRAND-DAME BUT THE WICKED WOLF WHO WAS IN THE END CAUGHT AND DEVOURED
IF YOU WANT THE RING YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE FINGER TOO I WILL TRY AND THEN THE RING WILL VERY SOON COME OFF SAID FARMER WEATHERBEARD
WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS HE HAD A GREAT TOWER BUILT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THERE THE PRINCESS WAS SHUT UP AND THE KING AND QUEEN AND HER TWO BROTHERS WENT TO SEE HER EVERY DAY THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE DULL
YOUR CHOICE ONCE MADE BE VERY CAREFUL NEVER TO LEAVE YOUR BRIDE FOR AN INSTANT AND REMEMBER THAT THE DANGER WHICH IS MOST TO BE FEARED IS NEVER THE DANGER WE ARE MOST AFRAID OF V DESIRE THANKED HIS HOST WARMLY AND TOOK THE ROAD HE POINTED OUT
AT LAST THE NIGHT FALLING THEY RETURNED DESOLATE TO HAMEL
NOW BRING ME MY HARP AND I WILL HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC WHILE YOU TAKE YOUR WALK THE GIANTESS OBEYED AND RETURNED WITH A BEAUTIFUL HARP
AH CRIED THE QUEEN CAN NOTHING APPEASE THIS ENEMY OF OURS
BUT DURING THE DAY THE GIRL WAS LEFT QUITE ALONE SO THE GOOD DWARFS WARNED HER SAYING
NOW JACK WAS SURE THIS HEN WAS THAT OF WHICH THE FAIRY HAD SPOKEN
BUT SOMEONE HAD BY THIS TIME TOLD THE WICKED QUEEN THAT GRACIOSA HAD COME BACK AND WAS AT SUPPER WITH THE KING AND IN SHE FLEW IN A TERRIBLE FURY
HER THOUGHTS KEPT TURNING TO THE BOOK IN WHICH STOOD WRITTEN THAT GREAT HAPPINESS WAITED HER SISTERS BUT THAT A FATE WAS IN STORE FOR HER SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN IN THE WORLD
AND SHE RUNS AND EMPTIES IT IN THE WELL WHERE THE VAGABOND STILL HOWLING TUMBLES IN AND IS DROWNED
YES SIRE ANSWERED SHE IT IS FOR MYSELF ALONE BUT I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO LET YOU TASTE SOME OF IT
AT LENGTH THEY FELL FAST ASLEEP AND THEN I STOLE SOFTLY DOWN AND SEEING SOME TURF CONVENIENT I PLACED ONE UNDER EACH OF THEIR HEADS AND OFF I WENT WITH THEIR GOLD AS FAST AS I COULD
THE PRINCE ANSWERED JOYFULLY YOU ARE WITH ME AND HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED ADDING I LOVE YOU BETTER THAN ANYONE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD
PRINCE IVAN STAYED WITH THEM THREE DAYS
YOU LOOK LIKE HERDS-WOMEN COMPARED WITH HER AND THE SECOND PRINCESS IS ALSO MUCH PRETTIER THAN YOU
SO THEY ALL THREE HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH THE GOOSE
FOR HE IS SITTING INSIDE THERE AND CALLING ME A FOOL FOR HAVING LET MYSELF BE TAKEN IN BY SUCH A FELLOW AS YOU WELL IT WOULDN'T BE VERY HARD TO DO THAT SAID THE MASTER THIEF
AND THE WICKED WOMAN HAD THEM STEWED IN SALT AND ATE THEM UP THINKING SHE HAD MADE AN END OF SNOWDROP FOR EVER
WE ARE BIDDEN TO THE ROYAL BANQUET SO THE OLD MAN GOT UP
BUT IT SO HAPPENED THAT THE KING KNEW BETTER FOR HE HAD THE RING HIMSELF AND HE SAID
PRINCE IVAN FATTENED UP THE COLT IN THE GREEN MEADOWS AND IT TURNED INTO A WONDROUS STEED
THEN THE LAD RODE INTO THE MOUNTAIN CLEFT AT FULL GALLOP AND CAUGHT UP THE PRINCESS ON HIS SADDLE-BOW AND THEN OUT AGAIN BEFORE THE TROLL EVEN HAD TIME TO STAND UP AND THUS THE PRINCESS WAS SET FREE
HE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR
GRACIOSA DID NOT HESITATE AN INSTANT BUT PASSED THROUGH INTO A CHARMING GARDEN
AND HAVING AN ENCHANTED RING HE THREW IT AT ME AND IT FELL ON MY BIG TOE AND REMAINED FASTENED TO IT
IT FLED BACK AND THE PRINCE RAN AFTER IT
THEN MARYA MOREVNA MOUNTED KOSHCHEI'S HORSE AND PRINCE IVAN GOT ON HIS OWN AND THEY RODE AWAY TO VISIT FIRST THE RAVEN AND THEN THE EAGLE AND THEN THE FALCON
WHEN HE SPOKE TO HIS WIFE AND SHE ANSWERED HIM INSTEAD OF THE USUAL PIECE OF GOLD A TOAD JUMPED OUT OF HER MOUTH
DESIRE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE HALF SO LOVELY AND HE STOOD GAZING AT HER IN DELIGHT
I AM SO HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DULLHEAD REPLIED
MY FRIENDS SAID SHE THE CRUEL GIANT WHO OPPRESSED YOU AND ATE UP ALL YOUR FLOCKS AND HERDS IS DEAD AND THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS THE MEANS OF YOUR BEING DELIVERED FROM HIM AND IS THE SON OF YOUR KIND OLD MASTER THE KNIGHT THE MEN GAVE A LOUD CHEER AT THESE WORDS AND PRESSED FORWARD TO SAY THAT THEY WOULD SERVE JACK AS FAITHFULLY AS THEY HAD SERVED HIS FATHER
WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE HAD DONE THIS SHE SAID
SO A HUNTING PARTY WAS ARRANGED BUT AS IT WAS VERY HOT WEATHER THE KING SOON GOT TIRED AND SAID HE WOULD DISMOUNT AND REST AT A CASTLE WHICH THEY WERE PASSING
BUT THE QUEEN THEIR MOTHER SICKENED UNTO DEATH WHEN THEY WERE YET VERY YOUNG WHICH CAUSED GREAT GRIEF THROUGHOUT THE COURT PARTICULARLY TO THE KING HER HUSBAND WHO COULD IN NO WISE BE COMFORTED
BUT JUST AS I CAME TO THE MOUTH OF THE ENTRANCE I SAW THE GUARDS OF THE PLACE COMING TOWARDS ME AND DISTINCTLY HEARD THEM SAYING THAT THEY WOULD LOOK IN THE VAULT FOR THAT THE BLACK THIEF WOULD THINK LITTLE OF ROBBING THE CORPSE IF HE WAS ANYWHERE IN THE PLACE
I TOLD YOU MY LORD THAT I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER MY GRANDMOTHER COME TO-MORROW AND I WILL MAKE YOU LADY-IN-WAITING TO THE COUNTESS AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY
NEXT MORNING DULLHEAD TUCKED THE GOOSE UNDER HIS ARM AND WENT OFF WITHOUT IN THE LEAST TROUBLING HIMSELF ABOUT THE THREE GIRLS WHO WERE HANGING ON TO IT
BUT NOW YOU ARE QUITE BIG ENOUGH AND MUST COME AWAY WITH ME NO SAID THE COLT I MUST STAY HERE ANOTHER YEAR
HER HAIR WAS RED AS FIRE AND SHE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT NOT A PRETTY ONE
THE GROUND AT HER FEET WAS ALL STREWN WITH ROBES OF GOLD AND SILVER RIBBONS AND LACES DIAMONDS AND PEARLS OVER WHICH THE TURKEYS WERE STALKING TO AND FRO WHILE THE KING'S UGLY DISAGREEABLE SON STOOD OPPOSITE HER DECLARING ANGRILY THAT IF SHE WOULD NOT MARRY HIM SHE SHOULD BE KILLED
BUT THE KING'S SON HAD BEEN PONDERING OVER ALL THESE THINGS AND HE SAID TO THE WIDOW WOMAN
I AM COMING WHEN SHE WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT HER HUSBAND RECOVERED HIS WITS AND WENT BACK INTO HIS HOUSE MURMURING
SHE MAY SIT THERE AND WELCOME THE REST OF THEM THOUGHT THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO STAY BUT WHILE THEY WERE DISPUTING ABOUT THIS AND LOOKING AFTER THE HORSES SHE CREPT FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE STABLE AND AT LAST SAT DOWN BEHIND THE DOOR AND WHEN ONCE SHE WAS INSIDE NO ONE TOOK ANY MORE NOTICE OF HER
EVERYWHERE WERE MIRRORS LIGHTS FLOWERS AND DAMASK HANGINGS
BUT NOW YOU SHALL COME AWAY WITH ME NO SAID THE DAPPLED COLT ONCE MORE
QUIETLY QUIETLY I THIS WILL NEVER DO
BUT HARDLY HAD SHE TOUCHED HER SISTER THAN SHE STUCK FAST AS WELL
BUT VERY SOON IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BEAUTY HAD THE BEST OF IT AND THE DWARF TURNED HER BATS HEADS AND FLICKERED AWAY IN GREAT CONFUSION WHILE THE FAIRY CAME DOWN TO WHERE THE PRINCESS STOOD AND SAID SMILING YOU SEE PRINCESS I HAVE COMPLETELY ROUTED THAT MALICIOUS OLD CARABOSSE
WHAT SHE SAID DO YOU DARE TO DISPUTE WITH ME FOR THE PRIZE OF BEAUTY AND EXPECT ME TO ENDURE THIS INSULT TO MY KNIGHTS
DON'T YOU MEAN TO TELL HIM THAT IS NOT MY INTENTION ARE YOU AFRAID NO PRINCESS WHAT MAKES YOU SO DISCREET THEN BUT MICHAEL WAS SILENT
THIS TIME A LITTLE HARE CAME RUNNING UP AT THE SOUND
SEE HERE IS A HONEYCOMB THAT I HAVE FOUND
X THAT DAY WHEN HE MADE UP THE BOUQUETS MICHAEL HID THE BRANCH WITH THE SILVER DROPS IN THE NOSEGAY INTENDED FOR THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
YOU KNOW HE TOLD YOU SO HIMSELF V THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS SOON AS SHE HAD PUT THE HOUSE IN ORDER THE GIRL SAT DOWN TO SPIN
VERY WELL THEN--GO
GOOD-MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE CHIEF OF THE SCULLIONS WHO HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP
SO HE WENT HOME WITH HER GLAD AT HEART BECAUSE HIS SHEEP WAS FOUND
THEN HE DIED
WHY SAID THE QUEEN THERE IS ONLY ONE MOUSE IN THIS GARRET AND THAT IS SUCH A DEAR PRETTY LITTLE THING THAT I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK OF ITS BEING KILLED WHAT CRIED THE OLD WOMAN IN A RAGE
BUT THE THIRD TIME DAPPLEGRIM SAID
MORE THAN EVER DID THE BABA YAGA STORM AT HER MARES AND SHRIEK
THANKS PRINCE IVAN CRIED KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS NOW YOU WILL SOONER SEE YOUR OWN EARS THAN MARYA MOREVNA AND OUT OF THE WINDOW HE FLEW IN THE SHAPE OF A TERRIBLE WHIRLWIND
PRESENTLY SHE HEARD HIM SAY
WHEN HE ENTERED IT ALL THE WINDOWS SHOOK AND CLATTERED IN THE STRANGEST WAY BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT HEED THEM
IF THERE IS SUCH A THING IN YOUR GARRET JUST THROW IT DOWN TO ME AND IN RETURN I WILL PROMISE THAT YOUR LITTLE DAUGHTER SHALL BE WELL TAKEN CARE OF THE QUEEN WHEN SHE HEARD THIS BEGAN TO CRY BUT MADE NO ANSWER AND THE OLD WOMAN AFTER WAITING A FEW MINUTES ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
PRINCESS THE KING AWAITS YOU THE PRINCESS WAS SURPRISED AND IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD VERY MUCH DELIGHTED AT THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CHARMING PAGE WHOM SHE COULD NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN BEFORE
OH ALL THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO TAKE YOUR GUN AND GO DOWN TO THE WATER AND AIM AT THE DUCK WHICH IS SWIMMING ABOUT THERE AND SHE WILL SOON DISCOVER HERSELF SAID DAPPLEGRIM
XII MEANWHILE THE PRINCE WAS COMING AS FAST AS HIS HORSE COULD CARRY HIM
GO TO THE CASTLE OF BELOEIL AND THERE YOU SHALL MARRY A PRINCESS THAT EVENING THE LITTLE COW-BOY WHO HAD BEEN THINKING A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE ADVICE OF THE LADY IN THE GOLDEN DRESS TOLD HIS DREAM TO THE FARM PEOPLE
THE LADY YIELDED TO THIS REASONING AND CONSENTED TO REMAIN AT HER NURSE'S HOUSE AS THE BEST PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
BUT HE WAS VERY WROTH AND NONE CAN BLAME HIM FOR THAT
MARRY YOU
AND YOU MUST ALSO ASK FOR TWELVE BARRELS OF RYE AND TWELVE SLAUGHTERED OXEN MUST WE HAVE WITH US AND ALL THE TWELVE OX-HIDES WITH TWELVE HUNDRED SPIKES SET IN EACH OF THEM
THEN JACK STOLE SOFTLY OUT OF THE WARDROBE AND WENT INTO THE HUGE KITCHEN TO SEE IF THE GIANTESS HAD GONE OUT
INTO THAT PARK THERE USED TO COME A HUGE BEAST--NORKA WAS ITS NAME--AND DO FEARFUL MISCHIEF DEVOURING SOME OF THE ANIMALS EVERY NIGHT
AND WHEN HE HAD FLUNG THE STONE ASIDE HE SPOKE A SECOND TIME TO HIS BROTHERS SAYING
IT HAD BEEN DARK THERE BEFORE BUT NOW IT BECAME DARKER STILL
I ASKED HER WHAT MADE HER CRY AND WHERE THE LORD OF THE CASTLE WAS FOR I WONDERED GREATLY THAT I SAW NO STIR OF SERVANTS OR ANY PERSON ABOUT THE PLACE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING HE SAID
NEXT YEAR WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN TO LOOK AFTER HIS MARES AND THE FOAL IT WAS AS FAT AS IT COULD BE AND ITS COAT SHONE WITH BRIGHTNESS AND IT WAS SO BIG THAT THE LAD HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN GETTING ON ITS BACK AND EACH OF THE MARES HAD ANOTHER FOAL
AND WHEN THEY HAD HAULED IT UP AND HAD SET EYES ON THE WONDROUS MAIDENS THEY WENT ASIDE AND SAID
I THINK I WILL CLIMB UP AND SEE HIS MOTHER WISHED HIM NOT TO VENTURE UP THIS STRANGE LADDER BUT JACK COAXED HER TO GIVE HER CONSENT TO THE ATTEMPT FOR HE WAS CERTAIN THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL IN THE BEANSTALK
BUT VERY SOON THE WICKED KING CLATTERED INTO THE ROOM AND IN A FURY BECAUSE THE QUEEN WOULD NOT ANSWER WHEN HE CALLED TO HER HE TORE BACK HER SILKEN COVERINGS AND TWEAKED OFF HER LACE CAP AND WHEN ALL HER LOVELY HAIR CAME TUMBLING DOWN OVER HER SHOULDERS HE WOUND IT THREE TIMES ROUND HIS HAND AND THREW HER OVER HIS SHOULDER WHERE HE CARRIED HER LIKE A SACK OF FLOUR
DEAF AND DUMB IS HE
BUT JACK CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A FOX AND BIT THE HARE'S HEAD OFF AND IF FARMER WEATHERBEARD WAS POSSESSED BY THE EVIL ONE ALL WAS NOW OVER WITH HIM.(25 25 FROM P
I BELIEVE THAT THIS MUST OPEN THAT LITTLE GOLDEN DOOR IN THE MIDDLE SAID THE PRINCE TO HIMSELF
THEN HE OFFERED HIS HAND TO CONDUCT THE PRINCESS AND SHE SAID SOFTLY
DAYS FOLLOW DAYS HOURS CHASE HOURS
DIRECTLY SHE GOT HOME SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO SPIN
IF NOT I CAN LEARN SAID MINNIKIN
IF NOT I CAN LEARN SAID MINNIKIN
IF NOT I CAN LEARN SAID MINNIKIN
IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME SHE SAID YOU WILL MANAGE IT SOMEHOW OR OTHER AND THE KING AND QUEEN NEED NEVER KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEN THE NURSE AND ALL THE OTHERS CRIED HARDER THAN EVER AND SAID EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF TO TURN THE PRINCESS FROM HER IDEA
IT WAS NOT AT ALL EASY TO FILL THE MILK-CAN WHICH WAS LARGE AND ROUND
I'M HERE THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE KING WALKED IN AND THERE STOOD THE LOVELIEST MAIDEN HE HAD EVER SEEN
DEAR ME WHERE AM I SHE CRIED
WHEN SHE GOT TO THE COURTYARD SHE FOUND THE PRINCE WAITING FOR HER
WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING FOR THE PRINCESS IN THE GREATEST TERROR AND CONFUSION BUT AS SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE KING SAID TO HIS PAGE
THE BOATS GLIDED ALONG RAPIDLY BUT LINA'S FROM BEING HEAVIER WAS ALWAYS BEHIND THE REST
AT LAST THEY SET FORTH ON THEIR WAY AGAIN BUT THE BULL WAS STILL WEAK AND AT FIRST COULD NOT GO QUICKLY
ONLY THE CRY OF THE OWL WHICH ROOSTS IN THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE XI AS SOON AS SHE GOT UP SHE FOUND THE BRANCH IN HER BOUQUET
YOU MUST TAKE US YOU MUST TAKE US AND HE ANSWERED
THE WEDDING-DRESSES HAD BEEN MADE NEVERTHELESS AND THE FESTIVITIES WERE TO BE SO SPLENDID THAT ALL THE PEOPLE FOR LEAGUES ROUND WERE FLOCKING IN TO BE PRESENT AT THEM
OH MADAM WHAT OUGHT I TO DO
THE FIRST DAY SHE WORKED VERY HARD AND DID ALL HER MISTRESS TOLD HER FOR SHE THOUGHT OF THE GOLD SHE WOULD GIVE HER
MY FAITH CRIED TUBBY
I WILL GIVE THE OTHER GIRL WORK TO DO ELSE SHE WILL WEARY AT HOME ALONE SHE DID AS USUAL
THE PRINCE POURED FORTH TEARS AND WENT AWAY
SHE STAINED HER FACE AND DRESSED HERSELF UP AS AN OLD PEDDLER WIFE SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE UNRECOGNISABLE
WHY DON'T YOU LOVE MY SON WHO IS FAR TOO HANDSOME AND TOO GOOD FOR YOU
THE PRINCESS STOOD DISMAYED AT THE SIGHT OF THE TERRIBLE SKEIN
AND WHEN THE BIRD HAD COME FLYING UP SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER LITTLE ONES WERE COVERED OVER AND SHE SAID WHO HAS WRAPPED UP MY NESTLINGS AND PRESENTLY SEEING THE PRINCE SHE ADDED
BUT NO SOONER HAD SHE TOUCHED ONE OF THEM THAN SHE STUCK FAST TO HER
THE GOLDEN GOOSE THERE WAS ONCE A MAN WHO HAD THREE SONS
IT IS ZIZI EXCLAIMED DESIRE WHO ENTERED AT THIS MOMENT
WHAT A MOUTHFUL OF GREAT WHITE TEETH YOU HAVE GRANDMOTHER THAT'S FOR CRUNCHING LITTLE CHILDREN WITH
AFTER HE HAD SETTLED DOWN IN HIS NEW HOME AND HAD GOT EVERYTHING IN ORDER ABOUT HIM HE WARNED HIS WIFE AND FAMILY THAT UNLESS THEY WANTED TO DIE THEY MUST ON NO ACCOUNT LISTEN TO A VOICE WHICH THEY MIGHT SOME DAY HEAR CALLING THEM
BROTHER PRAY DON'T DRINK HERE EITHER OR YOU'LL BE TURNED INTO A WOLF AND EAT ME UP AGAIN BROTHER DID NOT DRINK BUT HE SAID
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO LODGE SUCH A GREAT GENTLEMAN AS YOU
THE PRINCE CAUGHT IT UP AND AGAIN GAVE IT THREE WOUNDS
SO ONE DAY THEY MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SET TO WORK TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IT WAS NOT IN HIS POWER TO ACCOMPLISH AND THEY ALL TOOK TO THE ROAD TOGETHER AND LEFT HIM AT HOME ALONE
FIRE ROARED THE TROLL
THEN THE QUEEN SENT FOR THE FAIRY AGAIN AND SCOLDED HER FURIOUSLY
GIVE ME YOUR LEFT FRONT PAW MY LITTLE FOX IF YOU REALLY WISH TO LEARN HOW IT'S DONE THE FOX DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND THE MUSICIAN TIED HIS FRONT PAW TO THE END OF ONE OF THE BRANCHES
AT FIRST WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE WAS VEXED FOR HE WAS NOT FOND OF LADIES
OH WHAT CAN YOU DO THERE ANSWERED THE KITCHEN-MAID
I WISH I COULD LEARN HOW YOU DO IT IT'S EASILY LEARNT ANSWERED THE MUSICIAN
AND SINCE THAT DAY THEY REGARD IT AS CERTAIN THAT THE TRANSYLVANIANS OF HUNGARY ARE THEIR COUNTRY FOLK WHOSE ANCESTORS AS CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT THERE BY THE RATCATCHER
BUT FIRST SHE WENT TO THE ROCK AND KNOCKED AT IT WITH THE STICK WHICH WAS STANDING THERE AS THE BULL HAD TOLD HER TO DO
IT WAS ALL BUT DARK WHEN THEY GOT BACK TO THE KING AT NIGHTFALL AND HE HIMSELF WAS STANDING IN THE COURTYARD WAITING FOR THEM
AFTER A TIME THEY ALL CAME TO A TOWN WHERE A KING REIGNED WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS SO SERIOUS AND SOLEMN THAT NO ONE COULD EVER MANAGE TO MAKE HER LAUGH
BUT AS NOTHING THAT I CAN SAY WILL MOVE YOU I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO TRY TO DO MY BEST FOR THE PRINCESS I WILL HAVE SO HE WENT DOWN TO DAPPLEGRIM AGAIN AND TOLD HIM WHAT THE KING DESIRED AND DAPPLEGRIM THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT EASILY BE DONE
BUT EVERY INSTANT A BRANCH STRUCK AGAINST HER EYES AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER CARE SHE HAPPENED TO PULL OFF ONE LEAF
IF MIDDLE-AGED MY MOTHER
THEN THE FIRST OF THEM WILL CALL YOU--SHE IS THE ELDEST--AND WILL BEG YOU VERY PRETTILY TO COME TO HER AND HELP HER AND THE SECOND WILL DO THE SAME BUT YOU MUST NOT GO NEAR EITHER OF THEM
THE KING WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE SO GOOD AN OFFER FOR HIS UNLUCKY DAUGHTER THOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIRE THE PRINCE'S PORTRAIT WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM
THERE SHE MUST SLEEP FOR EVER TILL THERE CAME A KNIGHT WHO WOULD RIDE THROUGH THE FIRE AND WAKEN HER
BUT WHEN THE QUEEN RUSHED IN AND KISSED HER TWENTY TIMES IN A MINUTE AND LAUGHED AND CRIED AND TOLD DELICIA ALL HER HISTORY THE PRINCESS WAS WILD WITH DELIGHT
THERE YOU WILL FIND A SORRY COLT ROLLING IN THE MUCK
IF I COULD ONLY HIDE HER AWAY SOMEWHERE SO THAT THE CRUEL KING COULD NEVER FIND HER AS THE DAYS WENT ON THE QUEEN AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS GREW THINNER AND THINNER FOR THEIR HARD-HEARTED GAOLER GAVE THEM EVERY DAY ONLY THREE BOILED PEAS AND A TINY MORSEL OF BLACK BREAD SO THEY WERE ALWAYS TERRIBLY HUNGRY
DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NO SAID CINDERLAD
THE KING BECAME ILL AND THERE WAS NO DOCTOR WHO COULD CURE HIM TILL FARMER WEATHERBEARD ARRIVED AND HE DEMANDED THE RING WHICH WAS ON THE PRINCESS'S FINGER AS A REWARD
THEN SHE WAS QUITE PROVOKED AND SAID
IT ISN'T A WIFE HE HAS BROUGHT ME IT IS FAMINE HERSELF XIV WHILE THE MASTER COOK WAS UPSTAIRS THE GOLDEN BIRD CAME AGAIN TO PERCH ON THE WINDOW-SILL AND CALLED IN HIS CLEAR VOICE TO THE HEAD SCULLION WHO WAS WATCHING THE SPIT
SO YOU MAY GO WHEN YOU PLEASE ONLY REMEMBER TO CALL AND SEE ME BETIMES THAT WE MAY KNOW EACH OTHER WELL THEY PROMISED THEY WOULD AND WITH GREAT JOY THEY SET OFF FOR THE KING THEIR FATHER'S PALACE AND THE BLACK THIEF ALONG WITH THEM
THEN HE SPOKE AS HE DIED AND SAID
IT WAS EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER ALL OVER IT AND IT SHONE LIKE THE SILVER WOOD AND HE GAVE HER ALSO A MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE WITH HOUSINGS EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER AND A BRIDLE OF SILVER TOO
WHEN WE ARE ONCE UNDER SHELTER WE CAN LAUGH AT HER UPON THIS THE AMBASSADOR FOUND HIS TONGUE AND REPLIED GALLANTLY THAT THE FAIRY HAD EVIDENTLY FORESEEN THE FLAMES THAT WOULD BE KINDLED BY THE BRIGHT EYES OF THE PRINCESS AND HAD SENT THIS DELUGE TO EXTINGUISH THEM
BUT SURELY THERE ARE GREAT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR LAND IF NO ONE EVER DIES NO THEY REPLIED THERE ARE NOT GREAT NUMBERS FOR YOU SEE FROM TIME TO TIME A VOICE IS HEARD CALLING FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER AND WHOEVER HEARS THAT VOICE GETS UP AND GOES AWAY AND NEVER COMES BACK AND DO THEY SEE THE PERSON WHO CALLS THEM HE ASKED OR DO THEY ONLY HEAR HIS VOICE THEY BOTH SEE AND HEAR HIM WAS THE ANSWER
HOWEVER HE WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN I AND SUCCEEDED WHEN FOR A MOMENT I WAS OFF MY GUARD IN CHANGING ME INTO AN EAGLE WHILE MY QUEEN WAS LEFT IN AN ENCHANTED SLEEP
THEN THE GIANT CAME IN SAYING
I WILL JUST RUN BACK AGAIN AND FETCH IT NOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THEN I SHALL TAKE BACK A PAIR OF GOOD SHOES TO THE OLD WOMAN AND SHE MAY PERHAPS THROW A KIND WORD TO ME FOR ONCE SO HE WENT AND SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THE OTHER SHOE FOR A LONG LONG TIME BUT NO SHOE WAS TO BE FOUND AND AT LAST HE WAS FORCED TO GO BACK WITH THE ONE WHICH HE HAD
TUBBY SHOWED HIS PATIENCE BY ABUSING HIS SON
THE MASTER THIEF THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A HUSBANDMAN WHO HAD THREE SONS
AS SOON AS THEY HAD FINISHED THEIR MEAL THE GIANTESS ROSE AND SAID
MY DARLING ZIZI HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE WELL AND THE OTHER ONE ASKED TUBBY
THEN SHE PLUCKED RUSHES AND PLAITED A SOFT CORD OF THEM WHICH SHE FASTENED TO THE COLLAR
WHAT HE CRIED
BUT THE GARDEN WAS SURROUNDED BY A HIGH WALL AND NO ONE DARED TO ENTER IT FOR IT BELONGED TO A WITCH OF GREAT POWER WHO WAS FEARED BY THE WHOLE WORLD
AND IS THIS MY DELIVERER SAYS HE
I AM CALLED CURLICUE AND AM AN OBJECT OF DERISION
WHEN THE BABA YAGA GOT UP IN THE MORNING THE SORRY COLT WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
WELL SAID THE OLD WOMAN THERE ARE THREE OF US SISTERS
THEN HE ASKED WHAT IT MEANT AND THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM IT WAS NOTHING BUT WEAKNESS AND THAT SHE WOULD SOON BE ALL RIGHT AGAIN
HOWEVER I HAD NOT TIME TO LOSE
A LITTLE A LITTLE REPLIES THE WOLF PRETENDING TO COUGH
WE SHALL HAVE A TUSSLE FOR THAT SCREAMED THE TROLL
HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS MY FRIEND RIVER
IF THOU ART AN OLD MAN THOU SHALT BE MY FATHER
THE WOOD IS JUST AS MUCH MINE AS YOURS SAID THE BULL
THEN HE CONDUCTED HER BACK TO THE KING'S PALACE AND IF HONOUR ENOUGH HAD NOT BEEN DONE HIM BEFORE IT WAS CERTAINLY DONE NOW FOR THE KING HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN HOW TO MAKE MUCH OF THE MAN WHO HAD SAVED HIS DAUGHTER FROM THE THREE TROLLS
YET HE TOOK A NEW WIFE AND THEN ANOTHER PRINCE WHO WANTED TO HAVE MARRIED HER CAME UP AGAINST HIM WITH A GREAT ARMY
SHE GRADUALLY OPENED HER EYES LIFTED UP THE LID OF THE COFFIN AND SAT UP ALIVE AND WELL
AND FERRETING THUS FROM ROOM TO ROOM HE CAME AT LAST TO THE ONE WITH THE THRONE IN IT AND FEELING FATIGUED HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN ON IT TO THINK OVER HIS ADVENTURE
RENELDE HOPED SHE HAD GOT RID OF HIM WHEN ONE DAY HE STOPPED AT THE DOOR HIS DUCK-GUN UNDER HIS ARM AND HIS GAME-BAG ON HIS SHOULDER
SHE REACHED THE BIRCH TREE AND LAYING ASIDE HER FINERY SHE SAID
WHO IS GOING INTO THE OTHER WORLD TO OVERCOME THE NORKA NEITHER OF THEM OFFERED TO DO SO
BUT WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE CORN THEY COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM IT BUT FLEW DOWN AND BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND PICK AT THE CORN AND RYE AND AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE YOUTH AND DAPPLEGRIM AND DID THEM NO HARM
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME ALTOGETHER SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN ALL THE FOREST WAS LIGHTED UP WITH A SUDDEN GLOW
HERE YOU SEE THEIR MEAT AND HERE YOU SEE THEIR DRINK THEN THE KING KNEW HOW HIS WATCHING HAD BEEN DONE AND FELL INTO SUCH A RAGE THAT HE ORDERED HIS PEOPLE TO CHASE THE YOUTH BACK TO HIS OWN HOME AT ONCE
RENELDE GAVE HER PROMISE BUT IN THE EVENING GUILBERT ARRIVED AT THE COTTAGE
WHY STUMBLEST THOU SORRY JADE
WHY STUMBLEST THOU SORRY JADE
AFTER A LONG LONG TIME HE CAME TO A SMALL HUT AT THE FOOT OF A ROCK OUTSIDE WHICH AN OLD WOMAN WAS STANDING DRAWING WATER UP FROM A WELL WITH HER NOSE IT WAS SO LONG
FIRE YOURSELF SAID MINNIKIN
FIRE YOURSELF SAID MINNIKIN
FIRE YOURSELF SAID MINNIKIN
AND THIS IS THE VERY MAN THAT SAVED YOUR LIFE WHICH YOU MAY KNOW BY THE WANT OF YOUR FINGER THAT WAS TAKEN OFF AS YOU HAVE HEARD TO DECEIVE THE GIANT THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN GREATLY SURPRISED AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN TELL AND KNOWING HE WANTED HIS FINGER FROM HIS CHILDHOOD BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE STORY WAS TRUE ENOUGH
THEY WISHED THAT THEY ONLY HAD SUCH CREDITORS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
SO THE PRINCE GAVE IT A VIGOROUS TURN AND THE DOORS FLEW OPEN
HE TAKES BAG AND BAGGAGE AND PRESTO
AND MIND YOU BRING BACK A GOOD BIG ARMFUL OF WOOD FOR THE KITCHEN MINNIKIN PROMISED THIS AND RAN DOWN TO THE SEA-SHORE
NOW GO OVER SALT WATER AND FRESH WATER OVER HILL AND DALE AND DO NOT STOP UNTIL THOU COMEST UNTO THE KING'S PALACE AND IN A MOMENT THE SHIP WENT OFF SO FAST THAT THE YELLOW FOAM ROSE UP ALL ROUND ABOUT IT
ON THE MORNING AFTER THE WEDDING WHEN THE TWO GIRLS AWOKE MILK WAS STANDING FOR THE MAN'S DAUGHTER TO WASH IN AND WINE FOR HER TO DRINK
HELP ME IN HORSE-CHOOSING THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS SO SIGURD DROVE THEM AND ONLY ONE SWAM ACROSS
WELL SAID THE NURSE TO-NIGHT WHEN THE PRINCESS IS ASLEEP YOU MUST HELP ME TO THROW HER INTO THE SEA AND WHEN SHE IS DROWNED I WILL PUT HER BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES UPON MY DAUGHTER AND WE WILL TAKE HER TO THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WHO WILL BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO MARRY HER AND AS YOUR REWARD YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR BOAT FULL OF DIAMONDS THE BOATMAN WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS PROPOSAL AND SAID
THEY PROCEEDED THROUGH THE STREETS RETURNING THE SALUTATIONS OF ALL THEY MET GREAT OR SMALL AND ALL THE PEOPLE TURNED AND FOLLOWED THEM WONDERING WHO THESE NOBLE LADIES COULD BE
PERCINET AND THE PRINCESS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID NEVER A WORD AND THEN HE DID AS THE KING COMMANDED AND THE PROCESSION STARTED IN GREAT POMP
WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR THE FAIR THE YOUTH TURNED HIMSELF INTO A LIGHT-COLOURED HORSE AND BADE HIS FATHER GO TO THE MARKET WITH HIM
MY DEAR DO LET ME GO SAID MINNIKIN
ON AND ON SHE WALKED UNTIL HER LAST PAIR OF SHOES FELL IN PIECES
OFF WITH YOU INTO PRISON AND STAY THERE UNTIL THE PRINCESS ARRIVES SAID THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS
AND THIS TIME HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID BUT WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND THEN STRAIGHT ON INSIDE THE CASTLE
WELL HE SAID TO HIMSELF I HAVE ALREADY FOUND SOMEONE MORE FOOLISH THAN THOSE THREE SO HE WENT ON HIS WAY AND BY-AND-BY HE CAME TO A WOOD
MY LOVELY ROSE LAUREL WITH THE GOLDEN RAKE I HAVE RAKED THEE WITH THE GOLDEN BUCKET I HAVE WATERED THEE WITH A SILKEN TOWEL I HAVE DRIED THEE
THE MUSICIAN BOUND A LONG CORD ROUND THE LITTLE HARE'S NECK THE OTHER END OF WHICH HE FASTENED TO THE TREE
THE DUCHESS WAS SO DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA THAT GRACIOSA WAS REALLY ILL THAT SHE HERSELF RECOVERED TWICE AS FAST AS SHE WOULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE AND THE WEDDING WAS HELD WITH GREAT MAGNIFICENCE
NOW MUST I GO HOME AGAIN AT ONCE AND THOU HAST WASTED BOTH THY WISHES THEN SHE TIED A RING IN HIS HAIR WHICH HAD HER NAME UPON IT AND WISHED HERSELF AT HOME AGAIN
OH VERY WELL IF THOU ART ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO HAVE THY BACK FLAYED THOU MAY'ST HAVE THINE OWN WAY IF THOU WILT SAID THE KING
BEYOND THRICE NINE LANDS IN THE THIRTIETH KINGDOM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIERY RIVER THERE LIVES A BABA YAGA
FARMER WEATHERBEARD WENT AFTER HIM AND CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A GREAT PIKE
NOW COME AND PAY US A VISIT NOT SO BROTHERS
WHEN HE GOT THERE HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE QUEEN AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS HANGED ON THE NEAREST TREE
MASTER
BUT BEFORE THEY ENTERED THE WOOD THE BULL SAID TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER
IT BREAKS ENCHANTMENTS AND MAKES ALL WHO APPROACH IT YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL
BUT YOU SHOWED AN INQUIRING MIND AND GREAT COURAGE AND ENTERPRISE THEREFORE YOU DESERVE TO RISE
THERE CAME FLYING BEES IN COUNTLESS NUMBERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD AND BEGAN STINGING US ON ALL SIDES TILL THE BLOOD CAME THE BABA YAGA WENT TO SLEEP
AND BLANCHETTE THE LITTLE GOLDEN-HOOD KEPT HER WORD
THIS HAPPENED TO BE THE DUCHESS GRUMBLY'S CASTLE AND WHEN SHE HEARD THAT THE KING WAS COMING SHE WENT OUT TO MEET HIM AND SAID THAT THE CELLAR WAS THE COOLEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE CASTLE IF HE WOULD CONDESCEND TO COME DOWN INTO IT
LEAVE ME IN PEACE WITH MY TURKEYS WHICH I LIKE FAR BETTER THAN ALL YOUR FINE GIFTS THE LITTLE MOUSE WATCHED HER WITH THE GREATEST ADMIRATION FOR SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE SPRING
THE OLD GIANTESS SAW THEM COMING FROM THE TURRET LOOP-HOLE
WHEN THE SISTERS WENT DOWN SHE STAYED A LITTLE BEHIND AND SAID TO THE COW-BOY
THE KING WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK SENT QUICKLY AND HAD IT DUG UP AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS AS THE PRINCESS HAD SAID
THEN SHE DRESSED HERSELF UP AND ASSUMED THE FORM OF ANOTHER OLD WOMAN
I AM SO HUNGRY!'(15 15 CONTES OF CH
AT LAST CAME AN OLD OLD PIKE WHICH HE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN BRINGING HOME TO HIM
SO MUCH SO THAT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES THERE WAS NOT ONE LEFT ALIVE
WHY I AM YELLOW TOO AND IF I COULD ONLY THINK OF A WAY IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE DID THINK OF IT
AH BRIGAND SHE CRIES WAIT A BIT QUICKLY SHE OPENS HER SACK WIDE ACROSS THE DOOR AND THE MADDENED WOLF SPRINGS IN HEAD DOWNWARDS
ON THE LAST DAY GRACIOSA WHO HAD OFTEN FELT ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HER FATHER'S PALACE SAID TO PERCINET THAT SHE WAS SURE THAT HE COULD FIND OUT FOR HER IF HE WOULD WHAT REASON THE QUEEN HAD GIVEN HER FATHER FOR HER SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE
HOP HE CRIED POINTING WITH HIS FINGER TO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM WHERE THE WATER WHIRLED AND WAS DRAWN DOWN AS IF THROUGH A FUNNEL
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD SHE RAN TO THE DOOR BUT IT WAS COVERED WITH A THICK SPIDER'S WEB AND WHEN SHE BROKE IT SHE FOUND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
BUT THE OLD NURSE WITH MANY TEARS BESOUGHT HER TO REMEMBER THAT SHE HAD STILL A CHILD AND THAT IT WAS HER DUTY TO PRESERVE HER LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF THE POOR INNOCENT
LET HIM GO IN PEACE VI ONCE OUTSIDE THE YOUNG ADVENTURER PUT HIS ORANGES INTO A BAG THAT HUNG FROM HIS SADDLE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE QUICKLY OUT OF THE FOREST
MADAM WE FEAR THAT ROSETTE MAY BE THE CAUSE OF GREAT MISFORTUNES TO HER BROTHERS
THE PITCHER MAY GO MANY TIMES TO THE WELL BUT AT LAST IT IS BROKEN
IT WAS NOT WHITE BUT BLOOD RED THE SIGN WHICH TOLD THEM THEY MUST ALL DIE
HE FELT THAT SOME FRESH MAGIC MUST BE AT WORK AND IN HIS TERROR HE ALMOST TURNED AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
THEY SAT DOWN QUIETLY FOR A LITTLE AS THEY WERE TIRED AFTER THEIR DRIVE
THEN HE TOLD DAPPLEGRIM THAT THE KING HAD NOW REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD GET THE PRINCESS AS GOOD A BRIDAL HORSE AS THAT WHICH THE BRIDEGROOM HAD OR HE SHOULD LOSE HIS LIFE
I AM SURPRISED AT HIS NOT HAVING DONE SO SOONER AS SOON AS THIS MESSAGE REACHED THE FLEET EVERY PREPARATION WAS MADE FOR WAR AND THE NOISE WAS SO GREAT THAT IT REACHED THE EARS OF THE PRINCESS WHO AT ONCE FLEW TO PROTECT HER LOVER
AND ON THE THIRD MORNING WATER TO WASH IN AND WATER TO DRINK WAS STANDING FOR THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND MILK TO WASH IN AND WINE TO DRINK FOR THE WOMAN'S DAUGHTER
THE EAGLE SMOTE UPON THE GROUND AND BECAME A BRAVE YOUTH
THERE SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR CALLING OUT AT THE SAME TIME
DARKNESS BEHIND ME BUT LIGHT ON MY WAY THAT THE PRINCE MAY NOT SEE WHERE I'M GOING TO-DAY THE PRINCE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER SO HE TRAVELLED FOR A LONG AND WEARISOME TIME ALL OVER THE WORLD ASKING WHERE COMBLAND WAS
DAY AFTER DAY THEY WENT OUT HUNTING OR FISHING
IF I CAN'T GET YOU TO GO BY USING GOOD WORDS I WILL SOON MAKE YOU GO WITH BAD ONES BUT THE MAN WAS STILL UNWILLING SO THE MASTER THIEF FOLLOWED HIM THREATENING HIM WITH A GREAT BIRCH STICK TILL HE WENT WEEPING AND WAILING THROUGH THE DOOR TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE
SHE OUGHT TO BE JUST AS MUCH MY PRINCESS AS SHE IS YOURS NOW FOR YOU ARE A MAN OF YOUR WORD SAID THE YOUTH
THE KING REJOICED GREATLY WHEN HE HEARD SHE WAS INNOCENT AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTERWARDS.(22 22 GRIMM
THEN DULLHEAD ASKED ONCE MORE FOR HIS BRIDE BUT THE KING FELT VEXED AT THE IDEA OF A STUPID FELLOW WHOM PEOPLE CALLED DULLHEAD CARRYING OFF HIS DAUGHTER AND HE BEGAN TO MAKE FRESH CONDITIONS
WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY EYE CRIED THE OLD HAG
IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU IN RETURN YOU HAVE ONLY TO TELL ME AND ALL MY FAIRY POWER SHALL BE USED TO MAKE YOU HAPPY MADAM SAID PRINCE CURLICUE I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO RESTORE YOUR BELOVED FLORIMOND TO HIS NATURAL FORM SINCE I CANNOT FORGET THE TEARS YOU SHED FOR HIM THAT IS VERY AMIABLE OF YOU DEAR PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY BUT IT IS RESERVED FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO DO THAT
THEN GUDRUN WAKENED AND SAW HIM DEAD AND SHE MOANED ALOUD AND BRYNHILD HEARD HER AND LAUGHED
BUT WHEN HE REFLECTED ON THE SUBJECT HE SAW THAT IT WAS AS MUCH SEPARATED FROM THE VILLAGE BY THE PERPENDICULAR ROCK ON WHICH IT STOOD AS IF IT WERE IN ANOTHER LAND
THE GRASS AND BRIERS WERE GROWING AS HIGH AS IF IT WERE A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE ANYONE HAD SET FOOT THERE BUT THE PRINCESS GOT THROUGH AT LAST THOUGH SHE GAVE HERSELF A GOOD MANY SCRATCHES BY THE WAY AND THEN SHE WENT INTO A DARK GLOOMY HALL WHERE THERE WAS BUT ONE TINY HOLE IN THE WALL THROUGH WHICH THE DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER
BUT DAPPLEGRIM HAD GIVEN HIM SUCH GOOD INSTRUCTIONS THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND HIM
BUT I SOON FOUND HE WAS IN PURSUIT OF ME ALTHOUGH BLIND
SHE HAS SO GOOD A MARE THAT SHE FLIES RIGHT ROUND THE WORLD ON IT EVERY DAY
THE PRINCESS IN GREAT DISMAY RAN HITHER AND THITHER ALL ABOUT THE WOOD TEARING HER DRESS AND HURTING HER PRETTY WHITE HANDS WITH THE THORNS AND BRAMBLES BUT SHE COULD FIND NOTHING GOOD TO EAT AND AT LAST SHE HAD TO GO BACK SORROWFULLY TO FANFARONADE
SO WHEN THE GAOLER CAME WITH SOLDIERS AND CARRIED THEM DOWN INTO A BLACK DUNGEON WHICH SWARMED WITH TOADS AND BATS AND WHERE THEY WERE UP TO THEIR NECKS IN WATER NOBODY COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SURPRISED AND DISMAYED THAN THEY WERE
VI THAT EVENING WHEN THE PRINCESSES WENT UPSTAIRS TO BED HE FOLLOWED THEM BAREFOOT SO THAT HE MIGHT MAKE NO NOISE AND HID HIMSELF UNDER ONE OF THE TWELVE BEDS SO AS NOT TO TAKE UP MUCH ROOM
THAT IS WHY FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY SENT IN SEARCH OF THEM TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BUT NO ONE EVER CAME ON THE TRACE OF THE POOR LITTLE ONES
SO LET THE BANQUET BE PREPARED THIS WAS DONE WITH ALL SPEED AND EVERYBODY FEASTED EXCEPT MAYBLOSSOM AND FANFARONADE WHO LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE
I HAD BETTER GO AND ASK HIS ADVICE
BESIDES THE THOUGHT WEIGHED ON HER HEART THAT SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF DISOBEYING HER FATHER
AT LAST THE TIME CAME FOR HIM TO DANCE WITH THE LITTLE PRINCESS
AND IN THESE SPORTS SAID SHE ASK THE KING'S SONS TO PLAY A GAME AT CARDS WITH YOU WHICH THEY WILL NOT REFUSE
YOU MAY COME HERE AGAIN IN A YEAR'S TIME AND THEN I WILL TELL YOU IF THE LAD SUITS ME AND THEN THEY SET OFF AGAIN AND WERE GONE
HALVOR TOOK A DRAUGHT AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS ABLE TO SWING THE SWORD ABOUT WITH PERFECT EASE
WHENEVER HE CAME TO A NEW COUNTRY THE FIRST QUESTION THAT HE ASKED WAS WHETHER PEOPLE DIED IN THAT LAND AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT THEY DID HE SET OUT AGAIN ON HIS QUEST
AS SOON AS THIS THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM HE WENT OUTSIDE THE PALACE AND CALLED FOR KING PIPPIN BUT NO ONE CAME
YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD CRUNCH MY LITTLE GRANDCHILD
IF YOU LIKE I WILL GIVE YOU A HERB TO BREAK THE SPELL IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE IT TO ME SAID THE PRINCESS I WILL GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU CHOOSE TO ASK FOR FOR I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE HIM IN THIS STATE HERE THEN MY DEAR CHILD SAID THE WITCH TAKE THIS THREAD BUT DO NOT LET HIM KNOW ABOUT IT FOR IF HE DID IT WOULD LOSE ITS HEALING POWER
SHE CAME TO THE EDGE OF A MARSH AND SEEING A HERD OF REINDEER THERE SHE BEGAN ALL AT ONCE TO SING LITTLE BRIGHT-EYES LITTLE REDSKIN COME NURSE THE CHILD YOU BORE
SO THEY LIVED FOR TEN YEARS IN THIS LITTLE HOUSE AND THE TIME SLIPPED MERRILY AWAY
IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO CATCH SIGHT OF YOU HERE HE WOULD LEAD US A PRETTY DANCE SAID ONE
WHEN SHE CAME TO MOTHER HOLLE'S HOUSE SHE WASN'T THE LEAST AFRAID FOR SHE HAD BEEN WARNED ABOUT HER BIG TEETH AND SHE READILY AGREED TO BECOME HER MAID
YES THEY SAID
WHICH COUNSEL PREVAILING THEY CHOSE HIM A RICH AND BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS TO BE HIS CONSORT--A NEIGHBOURING KING'S DAUGHTER OF WHOM HE WAS VERY FOND
ALL THAT EVENING SHE NEVER SPOKE
WELL I'LL WAIT A LITTLE LONGER TILL WE REACH THE NEXT STREAM BUT THEN WHATEVER YOU MAY SAY I REALLY MUST DRINK FOR I CAN BEAR THIS THIRST NO LONGER AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THE THIRD BROOK SISTER HEARD IT SAY AS IT RUSHED PAST
BUT SHE WAS VERY SORROWFUL AND SAID TO HIM WHY DIDST THOU NOT REMEMBER MY WORDS AND LISTEN ONLY TO WHAT THY FATHER SAID
THE COUNT GREW PALE BUT HE REPLIED ROUGHLY VERY GOOD
SNOWDROP WHO DWELLS WITH THE SEVEN LITTLE MEN IS AS FAIR AS YOU AS FAIR AGAIN WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SHE BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH BECAUSE SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT SNOWDROP MUST BE ALIVE AGAIN
WHEN EVENING WAS DRAWING NEAR THE YOUTH WANTED TO GO
WHY SAYS SHE THE KING YOUR HUSBAND HAS THREE FINE SONS HE HAD BY THE LATE QUEEN WHOM HE KEEPS SHUT UP IN A TOWER UNTIL THEY COME OF AGE INTENDING TO DIVIDE THE KINGDOM BETWEEN THEM AND LET YOUR SON PUSH HIS FORTUNE
THE BULLET REBOUNDED WITHOUT HARMING THE SPINNER WHO STILL SPUN ON
PRODUCED BY CHARLES KELLER FOR TINA THE RED FAIRY BOOK BY VARIOUS EDITED BY ANDREW LANG TO MASTER BILLY TREMAYNE MILES A PROFOUND STUDENT YET AN AMIABLE CRITIC PREFACE IN A SECOND GLEANING OF THE FIELDS OF FAIRY LAND WE CANNOT EXPECT TO FIND A SECOND PERRAULT
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE KEEP OFF THE YOUNGER SISTER COULD NOT IMAGINE WHY SHE WAS TO KEEP OFF AND THOUGHT TO HERSELF
NEVERTHELESS ALL WAS GOT READY FOR THE WEDDING AND SHE WAS DECKED OUT AS A BRIDE BUT AS THEY WERE RIDING TO CHURCH A LITTLE BIRD SAT UPON A TREE AND SANG
DRINK SOME FOR YOU MUST BE THIRSTY I AM SURE
NO SOONER DID ZIZI FEEL THE PRICK OF THE PIN THAN SHE BECAME A BIRD AGAIN AND SPREADING HER WINGS SHE FLEW AWAY
THE KING THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR THE WORDS
SHE RAN TO THE BIRCH TREE AND BY ITS MAGIC POWER HER TASK WAS ACCOMPLISHED
I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THE STORY TOO AND IF IT BE AS WONDERFUL AS THE LAST I WILL PARDON THIS YOUNG MAN AS I DID THE OTHER MY WAY OF LIVING SIR SAYS THE BLACK THIEF WAS NOT GOOD AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE
SHAME ON YOU TO STRIKE ME SAID MINNIKIN
POOR GRACIOSA WISHED MISERABLY THAT PERCINET COULD ONLY KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND COME TO RESCUE HER
OH NO
DEAR MOTHER WHY ARE YOU SO SAD MY CHILD SHE ANSWERED I MAY NOT TELL YOU THE REASON BUT HE LEFT HER NO PEACE TILL SHE WENT AND UNLOCKED THE ROOM AND SHOWED HIM THE TWELVE COFFINS FILLED WITH SHAVINGS AND WITH THE LITTLE PILLOW LAID IN EACH
AND DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING
AND HE ORDERED A BARREL TO BE MADE LINED WITH SHARP NAILS AND IN IT HE PUT THE BAD OLD WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER
WHAT NEWS COURIER
NO BETTER FATE THAN TO BE PUT INTO A BARREL LINED WITH SHARP NAILS AND TO BE ROLLED IN IT DOWN THE HILL INTO THE WATER YOU HAVE PRONOUNCED YOUR OWN DOOM SAID THE KING
SNOWDROP LONGED TO EAT THE TEMPTING FRUIT AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT THE PEASANT WOMAN WAS EATING IT HERSELF SHE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION ANY LONGER AND STRETCHING OUT HER HAND SHE TOOK THE POISONOUS HALF
UGLY AND OLD AS THE CABINET WAS OUTSIDE NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RICH AND BEAUTIFUL THAN WHAT MET THE PRINCE'S ASTONISHED EYES
I TELL YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL I DO NOT MEAN TO COME SO GO AWAY AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE CALLED OUT AGAIN
THE BEER IS RUNNING ALL OVER THE CELLAR WE WERE THINKING WHAT WE SHOULD CALL THE CHILDREN THAT OUR DAUGHTER WILL HAVE WHEN SHE MARRIES THAT YOUNG MAN
WHEN SHE HAD DRESSED HERSELF VERY GORGEOUSLY FOR THE OCCASION SHE WENT TO THE MIRROR AND SAID
AS THE FIVE OF THEM TROTTED ALONG IN THIS FASHION ONE AFTER THE OTHER TWO PEASANTS WERE COMING FROM THEIR WORK WITH THEIR HOES
BUT THE KING GOT VERY CROSS WHEN HE SAW THEM WHISPERING TOGETHER AND CRIED HARSHLY
AS SOON AS THIS BABY WAS BORN IT BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT THE ROOM
WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE WAS MORE SPLENDID BOTH IN RAIMENT AND IN ALL ELSE THAN THE OTHER KING WHO DID NOT LIKE IT AND SAID
A FOX
WELL HE WALKED AND WALKED
FOR MY PART SAID THE PRIEST I CAN'T IMAGINE MYSELF BEING MADE A FOOL OF BY SUCH A FELLOW AS THAT WELL I ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL SAID THE GOVERNOR FOR HE MAY BE WITH YOU BEFORE YOU ARE AT ALL AWARE BUT THE PRIEST REPEATED WHAT HE HAD SAID AND MOCKED THE GOVERNOR FOR HAVING ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE MADE SUCH A FOOL OF
ALL THE TOWN WAS REJOICING AT THE THOUGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S APPROACHING FREEDOM AND WHEN THE NEWS CAME THAT KING MERLIN WAS SENDING HIS AMBASSADOR TO ASK HER IN MARRIAGE FOR HIS SON THEY WERE STILL MORE DELIGHTED
JACK TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND MADE HER A BOW
PERCINET IF YOU CAN STILL CARE FOR SUCH AN IMPRUDENT PRINCESS DO COME AND HELP ME ONCE MORE IMMEDIATELY PERCINET STOOD BEFORE HER
THAT IS ALL THAT IS LEFT OF THE KNIGHT'S MONEY
HE FOUND THEM ALL THREE SITTING ON THE STAIRS WHILE BESIDE THEM THE BEER WAS RUNNING ALL OVER THE GROUND FROM THE TAP WHICH WAS WIDE OPEN
LET US RETURN HOME SISTER SAID HE
I HAD NOT BEEN LONG THERE WHEN I SAW THREE WITCHES COMING IN WITH THREE BAGS OF GOLD
NOW IF YOU COULD TELL ME SOMETHING AS WONDERFUL AS YOU HAVE TOLD ALREADY I WOULD PARDON HIM LIKEWISE
WHEN THE THREAD OF THE NETTLES WAS SPUN SHE WOVE IT WITH HER SHUTTLE AND THEN CUT THE SHROUD AND BEGAN TO SEW IT
WILL YOU TAKE US
ALL THE GIRLS HERE ARE PINK AND WHITE AND I AM TIRED TO DEATH OF THEIR ETERNAL LILIE AND ROSES
I KNOW NOT HOW LONG IT IS SINCE I MYSELF CAME BUT DURING ALL THAT TIME I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CHRISTIAN MAN
A LITTLE FARTHER HE MEETS HIS SWEETHEART MY FRIEND RIVER WANDERING QUIETLY IN THE SUNSHINE
MEANWHILE ADMIRAL COCKED-HAT HAD DESPATCHED JACK-THE-CHATTERER-OF-THE-STRAW-BOOTS COURIER IN ORDINARY TO THE PRIME MINISTER TO TELL THE KING THAT THE PRINCESS AND THE AMBASSADOR HAD LANDED ON SQUIRREL ISLAND BUT THAT NOT KNOWING THE COUNTRY HE HAD NOT PURSUED THEM FOR FEAR OF BEING CAPTURED BY CONCEALED ENEMIES
AND WHAT ABOUT MY BABY DEAR AND HE ANSWERED
WHEN SHE WAS GOING UPSTAIRS HER WOODEN GOWN MADE SUCH A CLATTER THAT THE PRINCE CAME OUT AND SAID WHAT SORT OF A CREATURE MAY YOU BE I WAS TO TAKE THIS WATER TO YOU SAID KARI
I HAVE TWELVE HORSES IN MY STABLE AND I WILL PUT TWELVE STABLE BOYS IN IT ONE ON EACH HORSE
SHE WAS VERY STUPID AND DID NOT KNOW HIM AGAIN BUT SHE STOPPED A MINUTE BEFORE SHE TOOK HIM IN
I CAN'T STAND THIS I MUST BE THERE TOO
OH SHAME ON THEM SAID THE KING FOR IT ENRAGED HIM EVEN TO THINK OF THEM
HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT CLOSE TO THE CORNER OF A WOOD WHERE STOOD A LITTLE HUT BEFORE THE DOOR OF WHICH HIS HORSE STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD
HE HAD A TUTOR TO BE WITH HIM AND ONCE THE TUTOR BADE HIM GO TO THE KING AND ASK FOR A HORSE
NOW IF YOU DON'T FIND SOME MEANS OF DESTROYING THEM
SHE WAS QUITE WORN OUT WITH WEARINESS AND HUNGER AND EVEN HER STAFF WAS NO FURTHER HELP TO HER FOR IN HER MANY WANDERINGS IT HAD BECOME QUITE BLUNTED
MY LITTLE GIRL WAS CARRIED ABOUT AGAIN BUT HAD THE ILL-LUCK TO FALL AND GET HER EYE KNOCKED OUT
BEHIND THE CASTLE IS THE ORANGE GROVE
LET US SEE MY LITTLE GOLDEN-HOOD IF YOU KNOW NOW HOW TO FIND YOUR WAY BY YOURSELF
THE STAR GAZER WAS QUITE BEWILDERED AT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE SIGHT
BUT LET US MAKE HASTE INTO THE PALACE AS IT IS POURING CATS AND DOGS AND THE WICKED FAIRY CARABOSSE WILL BE AMUSED TO SEE US ALL STAND DRIPPING HERE
ONLY THE THREE LITTLE ONES WHO TOLD THE ADVENTURE HAD REMAINED OUTSIDE AS IF BY A MIRACLE
OH CRIED THE OLD HAG WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY EYE WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME TO GET YOUR EYE BACK SAID MINNIKIN
THE MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS HE RECOGNISED HER AS THE CHARMING SHEPHERDESS WHOSE PICTURE HE HAD SEEN SO OFTEN IN THE TOWER AND AS SHE WAS FAR PRETTIER THAN HE HAD REMEMBERED HER HE WAS DELIGHTED THAT CHANCE HAD LED HIM THAT WAY
BUT THE OLD WITCH CRIED OUT TAKE CARE AND KEEP THE CURTAINS DRAWN
I AM NOT AMBITIOUS AND HAVING SPENT ALL MY LIFE IN THIS TEDIOUS TOWER ANYTHING--EVEN A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY--WILL SEEM A DELIGHTFUL CHANGE
AND TAKING THE GIANT'S SPIT REDDENED IT IN THE FIRE AND RAN IT THROUGH THE EYE BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO KILL HIM
SAYS PRINCE IVAN
HE IS LORD OF ALL THE FISH IN THE SEA--YOU CAN ASK HIM
AND WHILE HE SLEPT HE DREAMT THAT THERE APPEARED BEFORE HIM A BEAUTIFUL LADY DRESSED IN A ROBE OF CLOTH OF GOLD WHO SAID TO HIM
JACK SAID SHE YOU HAVE ACTED LIKE A BRAVE KNIGHT'S SON AND DESERVE TO HAVE YOUR INHERITANCE RESTORED TO YOU
NOW WHEN THE YOUNG PRINCESS SAW THAT EVERYTHING FELL OUT EXACTLY AS HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN THE BOOK SHE GREW VERY SAD
AND WHEN THE YOUTH REPLIED THAT HE WAS GOING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE THE KING SAID THAT HE MIGHT ENTER INTO HIS SERVICE AND WATCH HIS SEVEN FOALS
AS FOR MINNIKIN FIRST HE WENT OUT ON THE TROLL'S SHIP AND TOOK A GREAT QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER HOOPS AWAY WITH HIM AND THEN HE TROTTED BACK TO THE KING'S PALACE
NEXT MORNING WHEN DAY WAS BEGINNING TO DAWN THE KING'S MASTER OF THE HORSE LET OUT THE SEVEN FOALS
SNOWDROP FELT SO HUNGRY AND SO THIRSTY THAT SHE ATE A BIT OF BREAD AND A LITTLE PORRIDGE FROM EACH PLATE AND DRANK A DROP OF WINE OUT OF EACH TUMBLER
YEARS ROLLED ON
DO YOU REMEMBER TELLING ME THAT I SHOULD NOT SEE YOUR PALACE AGAIN UNTIL I HAD BEEN BURIED
HE WISHED HIMSELF AT HOME AND INSTANTLY FOUND HIMSELF THERE
AFTER CLIMBING HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL HE GREW AFRAID TO LOOK DOWN FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BE GIDDY JACK AT LAST REACHED THE TOP OF THE BEANSTALK AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY FINELY WOODED WITH BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS COVERED WITH SHEEP
WHEN THEY HAD WALKED ON A LITTLE FARTHER THEY CAME TO A BROOK WHICH RAN THROUGH A GREEN MEADOW AND THERE THE YOUNGER SAID THAT THEY OUGHT TO CHRISTEN EACH OTHER
HOWEVER WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TREE THEY FOUND WHAT I HAD DONE AND MAKING FURTHER USE OF THEIR HELLISH ART ONE OF THEM WAS CHANGED INTO A SMITH'S ANVIL AND ANOTHER INTO A PIECE OF IRON OF WHICH THE THIRD SOON MADE A HATCHET
WELL THEN SAID THE MAN IF YOU WALK ON FARTHER ALONG THE SEASHORE HERE YOU WILL COME TO THREE PRINCESSES WHO ARE STANDING IN THE EARTH SO THAT THEIR HEADS ALONE ARE OUT OF IT
AND YOU SHALL BE MY BOY
BUT THE THIRD TIME YOU MUST SAY SHAME ON YOU THUS TO SMITE THE BELOVED OF MINE HEART
THERE THE BABA YAGA WAS STORMING AND RAGING AT HER MARES AND SHRIEKING
ONE DAY HE WENT ANOTHER DAY HE WENT AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE CAME TO WHERE MARYA MOREVNA WAS
SO THEY TOLD EVERYONE THAT EVERY MORNING AND EVENING THE YOUTH KNELT DOWN AND PRAYED TO AN IDOL WHICH HE HAD
HAST THOU WATCHED WELL AND FAITHFULLY THE WHOLE DAY SAID THE KING TO CINDERLAD
LOWER ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD AND DON'T GO AWAY FROM HERE BUT AS SOON AS THE CORD IS JERKED PULL IT UP HIS BROTHERS LOWERED HIM ACCORDINGLY AND WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE OTHER WORLD UNDERNEATH THE EARTH HE WENT ON HIS WAY
I AM MERELY GOING TO SEE WHY I AM WANTED
SHE WAS INTERRED WITH GREAT POMP AND MAGNIFICENCE AND THE KING HER HUSBAND BECAME IN A MANNER INCONSOLABLE FOR THE LOSS OF HER
NOW I SHALL HAVE TEN DOLLARS MORE CRIED THE OLD WOMAN INSIDE THE CASK
AS THE COUNT RETURNED TO THE CASTLE A COLD SHIVER PASSED OVER HIM AND HE FELT AS THE SAYING IS THAT SOME ONE WAS WALKING OVER HIS GRAVE
BOTH THE KING'S DAUGHTER AND THE PEOPLE IN THE PALACE ASKED THE DOCTOR IF THERE WERE NO OTHER MEANS OF SAVING HER AND BEGGED FOR THE BULL'S LIFE FOR THEY WERE ALL FOND OF HIM AND THEY ALL DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH BULL IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY
HERE I MUST STAY FOR ANOTHER YEAR
JUST AS THEY WERE TAKING LEAVE THE KITCHEN WENCH SPRANG DOWN FROM HER PLACE BY THE STOVE ON THE PRETEXT OF FETCHING SOMETHING FROM THE COWHOUSE AND IN GOING BY SHE WHISPERED IN THE PRINCE'S EAR AS HE STOOD IN THE YARD
WHO COULD KNOW THAT YOU WERE STILL ALIVE--YOU WHO HAVE BEEN A WANDERER SO LONG ANSWERED THE BROTHERS
THEN THEY WARNED HER ONCE MORE TO BE ON HER GUARD AND TO OPEN THE DOOR TO NO ONE
THEN SHE SAID
IT WAS FIRST A SLOW CARESSING SOUND THEN MORE AND MORE LIVELY AND URGENT AND SO SONOROUS AND PIERCING THAT IT PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE FARTHEST ALLEYS AND RETREATS OF THE TOWN
IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE YOU LEFT ME TO RUST AND HE HAS OILED ME
I HEARD ONE OF THEM SAY TO THE OTHER THAT IF THE BLACK THIEF CAME ON THEM WHILE THEY SLEPT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE THEM A PENNY
THEN SHE WENT ON A LITTLE FARTHER AND CAME TO A TREE LADEN WITH BEAUTIFUL ROSY-CHEEKED APPLES AND AS SHE PASSED BY IT CALLED OUT
SHE THANKED HIM GRATEFULLY FOR HELPING HER SO CLEVERLY AND THEY LAUGHED AND WERE VERY MERRY OVER THE WAY THEY HAD TAKEN IN THE DUCHESS AND HER WAITING-MAIDS
THEN THEY SET OUT TO SEE HER FATHER
THE MOTHER OF THE WIND HAD PITY ON HER AND TOOK HER IN THAT SHE MIGHT REST A LITTLE
WHEN SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD THE WITCH SHUT HER UP IN A TOWER IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT WOOD AND THE TOWER HAD NEITHER STAIRS NOR DOORS ONLY HIGH UP AT THE VERY TOP A SMALL WINDOW
WELL IT MIGHT BE DONE SAID THE MASTER THIEF IF I WERE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GET YOUR DAUGHTER SO THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT HE WOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD DO AND THEN HE SAID THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY HE WOULD RIDE OUT TO A GREAT COMMON WHERE THEY DRILLED THE SOLDIERS
BUT THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER GNAWED THE BONES UNDER THE TABLE
YOU LOOK LIKE SUCCEEDING--YOU WHO HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE BUT LIE AND POKE ABOUT AMONG THE ASHES SAID THEY
SO THE GOVERNOR GOT UP AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE OUT THROUGH THE DOOR THE MASTER THIEF STOLE IN AND WENT STRAIGHT UPSTAIRS TO THE WOMAN
LIKE HER SISTER SHE CAME TO THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOW AND FOLLOWED THE SAME PATH
BE QUIET STUPID OR YOU WILL SPOIL EVERYTHING NOW THEY TOLD THE KING THAT THE PRINCESS WAS APPROACHING
WHEREVER THEY WENT THEY MET WITH A JOYFUL GREETING

THAT ACCURSED BIRD SAID THE COOK
IN A FURY HE WOKE THE SCULLION WHO IN ORDER TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM BLAME TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
THE MORE THEY KILLED THE MORE CAME
IF THOU WILT DO WHAT I TELL THEE THOU SHALT CHOOSE AMONG US THREE SAID THE PRINCESS
NOW HE IS HERE SAID DAPPLEGRIM
FOR IF HE DID ALL HIS MAGNIFICENCE WOULD BE AT AN END AND THEN HE WOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
BUT YOU MUST NOT FORGET TO TAKE OFF THE HALTER FOR IF YOU DO I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM FARMER WEATHERBEARD FOR HE IS THE MAN WHO WILL COME AND BARGAIN FOR ME AND THUS IT HAPPENED
COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
YOU SHALL REST A LITTLE THE GOOD CHILD UNDRESSES BUT OBSERVE THIS
NOT LONG AFTER THE QUEEN HAD A FINE SON WHICH CAUSED GREAT FEASTING AND REJOICING AT THE COURT INSOMUCH THAT THE LATE QUEEN IN A MANNER WAS ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN
5 FROM P
AS HE MET WITH NO HINDRANCE HE SOON REACHED THE ENCHANTED WOOD WHICH SURROUNDED THE CASTLE AND THERE HE THOUGHT HE SAW THE PRINCESS SUNBEAM GLIDING BEFORE HIM AMONG THE TREES
THIS KING GRUMPY AS HE WAS CALLED HAD ONE SON WHO WAS AS DIFFERENT FROM HIS FATHER AS HE COULD POSSIBLY BE
HE CAUGHT THE HARE
NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS CAME FROM FAR AND WIDE TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE AND THE HIDEOUS QUEEN SAT IN GREAT STATE IN A BALCONY HUNG WITH CLOTH OF GOLD TO WATCH THE CONTESTS AND GRACIOSA HAD TO STAND UP BEHIND HER WHERE HER LOVELINESS WAS SO CONSPICUOUS THAT THE COMBATANTS COULD NOT KEEP THEIR EYES OFF HER
BE OFF AT ONCE YOU UGLY TROLL SAID HE
LOOK AT THAT WHITE STRAND THERE
HE STOPPED ON THE GREAT MARKET-PLACE BEFORE THE TOWN HALL TURNED HIS BACK ON THE CHURCH AND WENT ON WITH HIS MUSIC SINGING
HE DRAWS BACK CRYING AND SHAKING HIS JAW AS IF HE HAD SWALLOWED RED-HOT COALS
I HAVE NOTHING TO COVER ME NOW POOR CREATURE THAT I AM CRIED THE YOUNG WOMAN AND TRANSFORMED HERSELF FIRST INTO A DISTAFF THEN INTO A WOODEN BEETLE THEN INTO A SPINDLE AND INTO ALL IMAGINABLE SHAPES
BUT SHE STEPPED ASIDE SO QUICKLY THAT HE ONLY SUCCEEDED IN OVERBALANCING HIMSELF AND OVER HE WENT AND SANK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA LIKE A LUMP OF LEAD AND WAS NEVER HEARD OF ANY MORE
HE WALKED AND WALKED
THE MOTHER OF THE SUN OPENED THE DOOR AND WAS ASTONISHED AT BEHOLDING A MORTAL FROM THE DISTANT EARTHLY SHORES AND WEPT WITH PITY WHEN SHE HEARD OF ALL SHE HAD SUFFERED
DAY AND NIGHT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE AND AT LAST HIS PRAYERS WERE GRANTED AND HE BECAME VERY WEALTHY
MICHAEL COULD SEE NOTHING FROM HIS HIDING-PLACE BUT HE COULD HEAR EVERYTHING AND HE LISTENED TO THE PRINCESSES LAUGHING AND JUMPING WITH PLEASURE
BUT THE MAN FROM THE WOOD JUST TOOK UP HIS STAND BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN AND BEGAN TO EAT AND IN ONE DAY IT HAD ALL VANISHED
AT LAST THE DUKE OF BELOEIL ORDERED THE TRUMPET TO BE SOUNDED AND A PROCLAMATION TO BE MADE THAT WHOEVER COULD DISCOVER HOW HIS DAUGHTERS WORE OUT THEIR SHOES SHOULD CHOOSE ONE OF THEM FOR HIS WIFE
DESIRE WAS CHARMED TO ANSWER THEM
ONE DAY HOWEVER A YOUNG MAN ARRIVED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO HER AND HER MOTHER BEAMING WITH JOY SENT HER DAUGHTER DOWN TO THE CELLAR TO DRAW A JUG OF BEER
SIRE SHE SAID LET US COLLECT ALL OUR RICHES AND RUN AWAY AS FAR AS EVER WE CAN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD BUT THE KING ANSWERED
THEN HAVING PROMISED TO ASK HER SON ABOUT THE PRINCESS'S HUSBAND SHE HID HER IN THE CELLAR SO THAT THE SUN MIGHT NOTICE NOTHING ON HIS RETURN HOME FOR HE WAS ALWAYS IN A BAD TEMPER WHEN HE CAME IN AT NIGHT
THEN HALVOR CUT OFF THE FIRST HEAD AND AFTER THAT THE OTHERS BUT THE LAST WAS THE TOUGHEST OF THEM ALL AND IT WAS THE HARDEST WORK THAT HALVOR HAD EVER DONE TO GET IT OFF BUT HE STILL BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE STRENGTH ENOUGH TO DO IT
IT WILL TAKE SEVEN HERDS OF SHEEP SAID SHE AND THEIR INCREASE FOR SEVEN YEARS HOW MUCH BUTTER WILL IT TAKE TO FILL YOUR CROCK SEVEN DAIRIES SAID SHE AND THEIR INCREASE FOR SEVEN YEARS AND HOW MUCH WILL IT TAKE TO FILL THE BARREL YOU HAVE SAYS THE QUEEN
I COME TO BID YOU WELCOME TO OUR FAIRY PALACE IN THE NAME OF THE QUEEN MY MOTHER WHO IS PREPARED TO LOVE YOU AS MUCH AS I DO THE PRINCESS JOYFULLY MOUNTED WITH HIM INTO A LITTLE SLEDGE DRAWN BY TWO STAGS WHICH BOUNDED OFF AND DREW THEM SWIFTLY TO THE WONDERFUL PALACE WHERE THE QUEEN RECEIVED HER WITH THE GREATEST KINDNESS AND A SPLENDID BANQUET WAS SERVED AT ONCE
BUT TO PRINCE PEERLESS AND THE PRINCESS SUNBEAM SHE GAVE THE PALACE AND GARDEN OF THE GOLDEN BRANCH WHERE IMMENSELY RICH AND GREATLY BELOVED BY ALL THEIR SUBJECTS THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.(18 18 LE RAMEAU D'OR
BUT THEY HAD HARDLY GONE TWENTY YARDS WHEN A TREMENDOUS NOISE BEHIND HER MADE GRACIOSA LOOK BACK AND SHE SAW THE PALACE OF CRYSTAL FLY INTO A MILLION SPLINTERS LIKE THE SPRAY OF A FOUNTAIN AND VANISH
THE QUEEN WAS TERRIFIED AT SUCH AN EVIL OMEN AND TRIED TO PULL THE BLACK SCARF FROM THE PRINCESS'S SHOULDERS BUT IT REALLY SEEMED AS IF IT MUST BE NAILED ON IT CLUNG SO CLOSELY
HAIL GRANNY HAIL PRINCE IVAN
IF YOU GAIN HER AFFECTIONS LET HER MARRY YOU SO THE PRINCESS ANNA MARRIED THE RAVEN AND HE BORE HER AWAY INTO HIS OWN REALM
THAT DAY THEY HAD VERY LITTLE DINNER AND WENT SADLY TO BED KNOWING THAT FOR THE NEXT DAY THERE WOULD BE NONE AND JACK UNABLE TO SLEEP FROM GRIEF AND VEXATION GOT UP AT DAY-DAWN AND WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN
WHEN RITTER RED HAS TAKEN YOU HOME AGAIN AND GIVEN OUT THAT IT WAS HE WHO RESCUED YOU HE WILL AS YOU KNOW HAVE YOU TO WIFE AND HALF THE KINGDOM
PERHAPS YOU THINK WE HAVE STOLEN SOMETHING FROM YOU AT FIRST THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WAS TAKEN ABACK BY THIS BOLD SPEECH AND HAD HALF A MIND TO SEND THEM ALL AWAY TOGETHER
VIII MICHAEL FOLLOWED AND ENTERED THE BALL-ROOM IN THEIR TRAIN
AND WHEN THEY WANTED A MORSEL TO EAT THE VORACIOUS HORDE HAD SWEPT AWAY EVERYTHING FROM CELLAR TO GARRET
MAKE HASTE AND LET US GET AWAY FROM THIS UGLY TOWER AND VERY SOON THE KING WILL ARRANGE A GRAND MARRIAGE FOR YOU WHEN ROSETTE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN FULL OF FRUIT AND FLOWERS WITH GREEN GRASS AND SPARKLING FOUNTAINS SHE WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT NOT A WORD COULD SHE SAY FOR SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE
IF YOU CAN'T I THINK YOUR DAUGHTER IS MINE THE KING WENT AND LOOKED AT BOTH THE DAPPLED HORSES
I SHOULD NOT TAKE ANYTHING OUT
WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT FOUR STONE-THROWS FROM THE GATES THEY DISMOUNTED IN THE FOREST BY THE EDGE OF A FOUNTAIN
WHY WE NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN
IT WAS SO FINE THAT A BREATH OF AIR WOULD BREAK IT AND SO TANGLED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF IT
THEY ARE SENT TO STOP US SAID DAPPLEGRIM
IT IS BETTER THAT ONE SHOULD DIE THAN TWO AND THEN CLIMBED UP INTO THE TREE AGAIN
THE BABA YAGA GAVE HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BADE HIM SET ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
SO SHE BOTH HUNGERED AND BEAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER AND CHASED HER ABOUT INTO EVERY CORNER
THE PRINCE GAVE THE BEAST THREE WOUNDS
AND AS SOON AS YOU GET TIRED OF BEING HERE YOU WILL TAKE YOURSELF OFF TOO SAID HE
OH ANSWERED MINNIKIN I HAVE BEEN HOME A WHILE AND THESE HOOPS HAD FALLEN OFF SOME OF OUR BUCKETS SO I BROUGHT THEM AWAY WITH ME FOR YOU SO WHEN THE KITCHEN-MAID HEARD THAT THEY WERE FOR HER SHE ASKED NO MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MATTER
I AM A VERY OLD FRIEND OF YOURS AND I AM TRULY GLAD TO FIND YOU AT LAST
THEN THE PRINCESS ASKED IF HE HAD GOT HOLD OF ANYONE WHO COULD BREW A HUNDRED LASTS OF MALT AT ONE BREWING
EH SAID THE KING
WHEN YOU HAVE SPENT IT YOU MUST GO AND TAKE ANOTHER BARON'S CASTLE THAT HE SHAN'T IF I CAN HELP IT THOUGHT JACK
A KING SHALL COME AND MARRY HER THE GIRL IN THE MEANTIME WAS DOING AS THE DWARFS HAD BIDDEN HER AND WAS SWEEPING THE SNOW AWAY FROM THE BACK DOOR AND WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE FOUND THERE?--HEAPS OF FINE RIPE STRAWBERRIES THAT SHOWED OUT DARK RED AGAINST THE WHITE SNOW
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS COUNTRY SAID THE YOUTH
AT LAST SHE BROKE IT OFF TO HIM IN A VERY POLITE AND ENGAGING MANNER SO THAT HE COULD SEE NO MUSTER OR DESIGN IN IT
THE GYPSY BEGAN TO COMB HER LONG BROWN LOCKS WHEN SUDDENLY SHE DREW A PIN FROM HER STAYS AND JUST AS THE TITMOUSE DIGS ITS BEAK INTO THE HEADS OF LINNETS AND LARKS TITTY DUG THE PIN INTO THE HEAD OF ZIZI
IN A SHORT TIME THE MAN AND THE WOMAN CAME HOME AGAIN TOO AND THE WITCH SAID TO THE GIRL
IT WAS NOTHING REPLIED HER ELDEST SISTER
POOR SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED WHEN SHE SAW HOW HER LITTLE FAWN HAD BEEN WOUNDED
LET US GO AT ONCE AND BRING HER HERE IN THE MEANTIME THE WICKED PRINCE WHO WAS VERY ANGRY WITH DELICIA HAD SAT HIMSELF DOWN UNDER A TREE AND CRIED AND HOWLED WITH RAGE AND SPITE UNTIL THE KING HEARD HIM AND CRIED OUT FROM THE WINDOW
HE SPILT A DROP ON RITTER RED'S PLATE BUT NONE UPON HERS AND EACH TIME THAT HE DID IT RITTER RED FELL INTO A RAGE AND STRUCK HIM
SO THE DOVE CAME FLYING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW AND CHANGED ITSELF INTO JACK AGAIN AND TOLD HER ALL AS IT HAD HAPPENED
JACK WAS AMAZED TO SEE THEM PICK THE BONES OF THE BULLOCK AS IF IT HAD BEEN A LARK
REMEMBER HOW GOOD THE COUNTESS WAS TO MY MOTHER AN OLD OLD WOMAN NOW SPOKE
YET THEY WISH ME TO LEAVE THEM TO BECOME A MISERABLE QUEEN
THE BIRD APPEARED A THIRD TIME AND SAID
I MET A WOLF SHE TOLD THE BRICKLAYER AND I BROKE THE BUCKET ACROSS HIS NOSE THE BRICKLAYER ASKED HER NO MORE QUESTIONS BUT TOOK DOWN A BROOM AND GAVE HER SUCH A BEATING THAT HER PRIDE WAS HUMBLED A LITTLE
IT SMELLS OF A CHRISTIAN MAN'S BLOOD HERE WITH THAT HALVOR CUT OFF THE FIRST HEAD AND SO ON WITH ALL THE REST
THEY CONFESSED EVERYTHING BUT TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO SAY WHICH HAD LED THE OTHER TWO INTO TEMPTATION
SHE WAS MORE FRIGHTFUL THAN TONGUE CAN TELL
PRINCESS SHE SAID YOUR REGRETS ARE SO PITEOUS THAT I HAVE COME TO OFFER YOU THE CHOICE OF GOODNESS OR BEAUTY
FOR THE THIRD TIME DULLHEAD ASKED FOR HIS BRIDE BUT AGAIN THE KING TRIED TO MAKE SOME EVASION AND DEMANDED A SHIP WHICH COULD SAIL ON LAND OR WATER
SHE SHOWED HER THE TWELVE COFFINS FILLED WITH SHAVINGS AND WITH THE LITTLE PILLOW LAID IN EACH
SO HE SET OUT ACCOMPANIED BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND A GUARD OF ARCHERS AND ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO FIND THE OLD MAN AND THE PRINCESS FINISHING HIS DINNER
NOW HE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO THROW YOUR DOG INTO THE SEA ANSWERED THE STEP-MOTHER
BUT HER MOTHER REFUSED TO LET HER GO SAYING
WHEN HE WAS TAKING HER BACK TO HER PLACE SHE SAID TO HIM IN A MOCKING VOICE
IT IS SHE ALSO WHO PERMITS ME TO SHOW MY GRATITUDE TO YOU BY GRANTING WHATEVER FAVOUR YOU MAY ASK OF ME
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT DULLHEAD BEGGED SO HARD TO BE ALLOWED TO GO THAT AT LAST HIS FATHER SAID
VIII AT THE SAME HOUR GUILBERT RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY AND AS HE HAD NEVER CEASED TO LOVE RENELDE HE MARRIED HER EIGHT DAYS LATER
AND WORSE THAN THIS SHE WAS SO HARD-HEARTED THAT SHE TOOK RAPUNZEL TO A LONELY DESERT PLACE AND THERE LEFT HER TO LIVE IN LONELINESS AND MISERY
ANY ONE MAY EASILY IMAGINE WHAT A FURY THE MAN FELL INTO WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAW THAT HIS OX WAS GONE
SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM AND WITHOUT AS MUCH AS BY YOUR LEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE SHE FLOUNCED INTO THE ROOM SAT HERSELF DOWN AT THE FIRE AND BEGAN TO EAT HER BREAD AND BUTTER AND CAKES
SHE DASHED UP TO THE FIERY RIVER GAVE A GLANCE AND SAID A CAPITAL BRIDGE SHE DROVE ON TO THE BRIDGE BUT HAD ONLY GOT HALF-WAY WHEN THE BRIDGE BROKE IN TWO AND THE BABA YAGA WENT FLOP INTO THE RIVER
HAVE YOU NOTHING TO TELL ME NO THEY ANSWERED
THE KING THEN SENT FOR HIS DAUGHTER AND ADVISED HER TO SUBMIT TO FATE AS THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE
THUS HE BECAME KING
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
GOOD-MORNING NEIGHBOUR SAYS THE FRIEND WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SO EARLY I AM GOING TO THE KING FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH
THE ELDEST FITTED THE KEY INTO THE LOCK AND SNAP
THERE PUT ON THIS DRESS AND GO OUT INTO THE WOOD AND FETCH ME A BASKET OF STRAWBERRIES NOW HEAVEN HELP US REPLIED HER STEPDAUGHTER
THE PRINCE SPENT THREE DAYS WITH THEM
SHE SHALL GROW UGLIER EVERY DAY THE SECOND
DENLIN
THEN DAPPLEGRIM NEIGHED AGAIN
FOR HER HEART WAS BROKEN AND HER PRIDE WAS BROKEN IN THE SAME HOUR
AT LAST HE SAID
THEN THE COUNT FELL ILL AND THE COUNTESS SUPPOSED THAT RENELDE WEARY OF WAITING HAD BEGUN HER SPINNING ANEW
AND IT WAS SETTLED THEN THAT RITTER RED SHOULD MARRY HER AND RECEIVE HALF THE KINGDOM
IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY MARES I'LL GIVE YOU AN HEROIC STEED
AS SOON AS MINNIKIN HAD GOT SAFELY ON HIS SHIP AGAIN HE SAID
HE WENT UP AND EXAMINED IT AND FOUND THAT IT RESTED AGAINST THE EBONY AND GOLD PANELLING JUST LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER PICTURES IN THE GALLERY
THE WICKED QUEEN WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO PUNISH GRACIOSA THAT SHE THOUGHT THE SUN WOULD NEVER SET
MOON
IF ONLY THE TROLL WERE NOT SO QUICK-TEMPERED I MIGHT HAVE TOLD HIM THAT ANSWERED THE PRINCESS BUT HE IS SO ILL-NATURED THAT HE WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES I FEAR AS SOON AS HE COMES IN
SHE SAID NOTHING BUT LET HER ARMS FALL BACKWARDS AND SUDDENLY BENDING HERSELF FORWARD SHE SLIPPED OUT OF THE COAT LEAVING IT IN HER HUSBAND'S HANDS
CHOOSE THEN SAID THE DUKE WHICHEVER YOU PREFER MY CHOICE IS ALREADY MADE REPLIED THE GARDEN BOY AND HE OFFERED HIS HAND TO THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS WHO BLUSHED AND LOWERED HER EYES
BUT NO SOONER WAS THE PRIEST SAFELY INSIDE IT THAN THE MASTER THIEF BEGAN TO DRAG HIM AWAY OVER STOCKS AND STONES
HUTETU SAID ONE OF THEM SHIVERING AGAIN
GO AWAY I TELL YOU OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU
THAT'S ALL I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO-NIGHT FOR IT IS FEARFUL WEATHER OUTSIDE
I AM AS GOOD A KING AS YOURSELF AND HAVE A SPLENDID KINGDOM AND ROBES AND CROWNS AND PLENTY OF GOOD RED GOLD TO DO WHAT I LIKE WITH
SO THE HEADS ALL BEGAN TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND TO ASK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO FOR THIS GIRL WHO WAS SO FULL OF KINDLINESS
THE KING'S ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP AND BEHELD THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS WITH THE GOLDEN STAR ON HER FOREHEAD HE WAS SO ENCHANTED BY HER BEAUTY THAT HE ASKED HER ON THE SPOT TO BE HIS WIFE
SO THEN THEY ATE AND DRANK AND WERE HAPPY AND NEXT MORNING HE SET OFF IN THE GREY LIGHT OF DAWN
HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO LIFT HIMSELF UP AND PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS BAG
SHE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIM AT FIRST AND WAS EAGER AT ONCE TO GO BACK AND SHARE THE FATE OF HER DEAR ONES
THEN THROW DOWN THE THREE FEATHERS WHICH YOU PLUCKED OUT OF HIS HEAD SAID THE EAGLE
NOW WHEN THE POOR CHILD FOUND HERSELF ALONE IN THE BIG WOOD THE VERY TREES AROUND HER SEEMED TO ASSUME STRANGE SHAPES AND SHE FELT SO FRIGHTENED SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
SEE NOW THE REWARD OF YOUR FOLLY
THUS FIFTEEN YEARS WENT BY AND THE QUEEN HAD SOMEWHAT RECOVERED FROM HER GRIEF WHEN THE NEWS REACHED HER THAT THE SON OF THE WICKED KING WISHED TO MARRY THE LITTLE MAIDEN WHO KEPT THE TURKEYS AND THAT SHE HAD REFUSED HIM
TITTY WAS OFTEN SENT BY THE BRICKLAYER TO FETCH WATER FROM THE FOUNTAIN AND AS SHE WAS VERY PROUD AND LAZY THE GYPSY DISLIKED THIS VERY MUCH
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ARE THEY ALL THERE FRIEND BLANCHET ASKED THE BAGPIPER
HIS QUEEN HAD LEFT ONE DAUGHTER BEHIND HER AND SHE WAS SO WISE AND SO PRETTY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO BE WISER OR PRETTIER
SCENTEST THOU ANY ILL PRINCE IVAN HAS COME AND HAS CARRIED OFF MARYA MOREVNA KOSHCHEI GALLOPED OFF CAUGHT PRINCE IVAN CHOPPED HIM INTO LITTLE PIECES PUT THEM INTO A BARREL SMEARED IT WITH PITCH AND BOUND IT WITH IRON HOOPS AND FLUNG IT INTO THE BLUE SEA
NAY SHE CRIED CAN CHRISTIAN FOLK DARE TO COME HITHER
MY CHILD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TAKING ONE OF THEM OFF THE ROPE SHE TIED HERSELF ON IN ITS PLACE AND WHEN THE CLOCK WAS WOUND UP SHE WENT TRIUMPHANTLY INTO THE TURRET
AT LAST DRAGGING HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY CAME A BIG RAT WHITE WITH AGE AND STOPPED ON THE BANK
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE HASTE IF YOU MEAN TO GO WITH ME SAID THE WEST WIND
BUT MINNIKIN HAD BREWED THE WORT SO STRONG THAT THEY ALL FELL DOWN DEAD LIKE SO MANY FLIES AS SOON AS THEY HAD DRUNK ANY OF IT
I ENTREAT YOU TO MAKE ME LESS RIDICULOUS RISE PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY TOUCHING HIM WITH THE GOLDEN BRANCH
BUT AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS LEAST EXPECTED THE BEAUTIFUL HORSE BEGAN TO PLUNGE AND REAR AND KICK AND FINALLY TO RUN AWAY AT SUCH A PACE THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP HIM
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO-DAY AND SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF
IT'S COLD ENOUGH TO FREEZE A POOR OLD BODY TO DEATH AND SHE SHIVERED AND SHOOK AGAIN AND SAID FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE GIVE ME LEAVE TO STAY HERE AND SIT JUST INSIDE THE STABLE DOOR YOU WILL GET NOTHING OF THE KIND
I KNOW THAT IT IS TO YOU I OWE MY DELIVERANCE FROM AN ENCHANTMENT WHICH HAS HELD ME FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS
WHAT A POOR HELPLESS OLD CREATURE SAID ANOTHER WHO FELT SORRY FOR HER
AT LAST SHE REACHED A BEAUTIFUL GREEN MEADOW ON THE EDGE OF A WOOD
AND FROM THAT TIME THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO DIE LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS ALL THE WORLD OVER.(13 13 ROUMANIAN TALES FROM THE GERMAN OF MITE THREMNITZ
REMEMBER NOT THE PAST
AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE STABLE BOYS FOUND IT RATHER COLD WORK TO SIT STILL ON HORSEBACK
VII WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF HE HAD A PLEASANT FEELING OF FRESHNESS ALL ABOUT HIM
NO SOONER DID RITTER RED SEE THAT ALL DANGER WAS OVER THAN HE CREPT DOWN FROM THE TREE AND THREATENED THE KING'S DAUGHTER TILL HE MADE HER PROMISE TO SAY THAT HE HAD RESCUED HER
THESE THAT I HAVE ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING SO HE GOT MORE AND SO MANY THAT THERE WAS A SWARM OF THEM AND THEN THE BREWING WENT ON
WHY SHOULD I NOT SPEAK AS WELL AS YOU
WELL SAID THE GOVERNOR I CERTAINLY AM THE CHIEF MAN ABOUT HERE BUT PEOPLE SOON BEGIN TO TALK AND IT WOULD BE VERY UNPLEASANT IF THEY WERE TO SEE THIS DEAD BODY
LAY AND SHE INSTANTLY LAID A GOLDEN EGG
THE GIANT THEN CALLED TO THE RING WHERE IT WAS AND TO MY GREAT SURPRISE IT MADE HIM ANSWER ON MY FOOT
THAT I CANNOT TELL THEE AND AS THOU HAST PROCURED SUCH A SPLENDID BRIDAL HORSE FOR MY DAUGHTER THOU SHALT HAVE HER
NOW THAT WE HAVE SUFFERED FOR EACH OTHER AND HAVE FOUND EACH OTHER AGAIN LET US FORGET THE PAST AND IN THEIR JOY THEY KISSED ONE ANOTHER
NEXT YOU WILL SEE A BAKING WOMAN LEANING OVER HER HEATED OVEN
BUT AS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHICH ROAD HE HAD TAKEN THEY WENT ALL WAYS EXCEPT THE RIGHT ONE AND INSTEAD OF BRINGING HIM BACK THEY RETURNED THEMSELVES WHEN IT GREW DARK WITH THEIR HORSES WORN OUT AND COVERED WITH DUST
THEN ALTERING HER MIND WENT ON HER WAY
SO SHE MADE HER LIE ON THE SIDE OF THE MISSING EYE IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE KING'S NOTICING ANYTHING
HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY SAYS HE
WILL YOU COME WITH ME TO MY FATHER'S PALACE AND BE MY WIFE SNOWDROP CONSENTED AND WENT WITH HIM AND THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WITH GREAT POMP AND SPLENDOUR
BUT FIRST THEY WERE TO CUT THREE RED STRIPES IN HIS BACK AND RUB SALT INTO THEM
WHEN THEY REACHED THE FOREST THEY DISMOUNTED FOR THE TREES GREW SO THICKLY THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT PASS AND MADE THEIR WAY ON FOOT TO THE HOLLOW TREE WHERE THE HERMIT LIVED
BUT THE ROBBERS THEY KNEW IT WELL BECAUSE THEY GOT OUT THEIR MAGIC
HEAVEN HAS SENT US DOWN THIS THING DRAKESTAIL WHO WAS NO LONGER SURPRISED AT ANYTHING RECEIVED THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE AS IF HE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE ALL HIS LIFE
AND THEN WITH A SIMPLICITY QUITE NATURAL IN A GIRL WHO SO LATELY HAD BEEN A CANARY SHE TOLD ALL HER STORY
HE GAVE HIMSELF NO REST BUT WALKED OR RAN THE LIVELONG DAY
FLOWERS AND FRUIT GREW ON EVERY SIDE FOUNTAINS PLASHED AND BIRDS SANG IN THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD AND WHEN SHE REACHED A GREAT AVENUE OF TREES AND LOOKED UP TO SEE WHERE IT WOULD LEAD HER SHE FOUND HERSELF CLOSE TO THE PALACE OF CRYSTAL
LET US MAKE HASTE TO LAND FOR WE MUST BE QUITE NEAR THE CITY OF THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS THE KING HAD SENT A HUNDRED CARRIAGES TO MEET THEM DRAWN BY EVERY KIND OF STRANGE ANIMAL
DO IT YOURSELVES
AND THEY RULED AS ONLY KINGS RULE WHO HAVE SUFFERED MANY THINGS
HE TRIED TO EAT HIS SUPPER BUT COULD NOT
THERE THOU SHALT LIE DOWN
HE FLED LIKE LIGHTNING WITH THE HARP TALKING TO IT AS HE WENT FOR HE SAW IT WAS A FAIRY AND TELLING IT HE WAS THE SON OF ITS OLD MASTER THE KNIGHT
BUT WHEN THEY GOT INTO THE WOOD IT WAS STILL THICKER THAN THE SILVER WOOD AND THE FARTHER THEY GOT INTO IT THE WORSE IT GREW
HEAVEN AND OUR HEARTS ARE WEEPING TOGETHER TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A LARGE FOREST AND WERE SO TIRED OUT WITH HUNGER AND THEIR LONG WALK AS WELL AS ALL THEIR TROUBLE THAT THEY CREPT INTO A HOLLOW TREE AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO DEPART AT ONCE FOR A TROLL LIVES HERE WHO HAS SIX HEADS NO I SHALL NOT GO SAID HALVOR
SO THE LAST FAIRY WHO HAD NOT YET GIVEN HER GIFT TRIED TO MEND MATTERS BY PROMISING THE PRINCESS A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE AFTER THE FATAL TIME WAS OVER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT FINE TIMES WE HAVE HAD AT THE PALACE
HOW LONG THEY SAILED I HAVE NO IDEA BUT AFTER A LONG LONG TIME THERE WAS A TERRIBLE STORM AND WHEN IT WAS OVER AND ALL HAD BECOME CALM AGAIN THEY KNEW NOT WHERE THEY WERE FOR THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY TO A STRANGE COAST OF WHICH NONE OF THEM HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE
ONE DAY PRINCE IVAN AND HIS TWO SISTERS WENT OUT TO STROLL IN THE GARDEN GREEN
BS BS BAYONET THEM
BUT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD DO IT THOUGH A GREAT NUMBER HAD TRIED
CRIED THE PRIEST IN THE SACK
THEY ARE SENT OUT TO STOP US
IF THOU ART BROTHER TO THOSE TWO THOU TOO ART NOT GOOD FOR MUCH
KING PIPPIN AT ONCE AGREED TO THIS
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IT ASKED
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IT ASKED
AND THEN SHE TOLD ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THE QUEEN FIRST REJOICED OVER THE THOUGHT OF DELICIA'S BEAUTY AND THEN WEPT AT THE IDEA OF HER BEING A TURKEY-MAIDEN
THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE INVITED AGAIN TO THE KING'S BANQUET
IT IS BETTER TO DIE THAN TO BE A COWARD THEN HE ASSEMBLED ALL HIS ARMED MEN AND AFTER BIDDING THE QUEEN A TENDER FAREWELL HE MOUNTED HIS SPLENDID HORSE AND RODE AWAY
BUT IN VAIN HE RUMMAGED IN ALL THE DRAWERS
THEN ALL THE COOKS AND SCULLIONS SPRANG AFTER IT KNOCKING AT IT WITH THEIR APRONS
INDEED SHE WAS SO PRETTY THAT IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE TO LOOK AT HER
JACK DID NO WORK AS YET AND BY DEGREES THEY GREW DREADFULLY POOR
GOOD SAID THE WOLF TO HIMSELF I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO HE SHUTS THE DOOR PULLS ON THE GRANDMOTHER'S NIGHT-CAP DOWN TO HIS EYES THEN HE LIES DOWN ALL HIS LENGTH IN THE BED AND DRAWS THE CURTAINS
MY DEAR FRIEND MINNIKIN WHERE HAVE YOU GOT ALL THAT FROM FOR SHE WAS HALF AFRAID THAT HE HAD NOT COME BY IT HONESTLY
AH SAID THEY THE EVIL IS ACCOMPLISHED SURE ENOUGH THEN THE EAGLE HURRIED TO THE BLUE SEA CAUGHT HOLD OF THE BARREL AND DRAGGED IT ASHORE
AT A TURN OF THE ROAD UNDER THE TREES SUDDENLY WHO GOES THERE FRIEND WOLF HE HAD SEEN THE CHILD START ALONE AND THE VILLAIN WAS WAITING TO DEVOUR HER
MAKE HASTE AND BEGIN TO LOVE HIM THIS INSTANT OR YOU SHALL BE TARRED AND FEATHERED THEN THE POOR LITTLE PRINCESS SHAKING WITH TERROR WENT DOWN ON HER KNEES CRYING
I WILL SAYS HE BUT WITH YOUR WOODEN LEGS YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED
BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE PARK HE WENT INTO A TRAKTIR OR TAVERN AND THERE HE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT IN REVELRY
IF OUR THIRTEENTH CHILD IS A GIRL ALL HER TWELVE BROTHERS MUST DIE SO THAT SHE MAY BE VERY RICH AND THE KINGDOM HERS ALONE THEN HE ORDERED TWELVE COFFINS TO BE MADE AND FILLED THEM WITH SHAVINGS AND PLACED A LITTLE PILLOW IN EACH
THE BOY IS QUIETER AT NIGHT TO BE SURE WHEN HE HAS BEEN IN THE WOOD ALL DAY SO THE WIDOW TOOK THE CHILD IN HER ARMS AND CARRIED IT TO THE MARSH IN THE FOREST
AND HAVING THOUGHT OF THE EXPERIMENT HE AT ONCE RESOLVED TO CARRY IT OUT FOR JACK WAS A GOOD CLIMBER
THE NIGHT PASSED AND WHEN THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE WITCH AWAKENED HER HUSBAND CRYING
AND THIS TIME STILL FINER CLOTHES WERE GIVEN TO HER AND A VERY BEAUTIFUL STEED
HE WEPT AND LAMENTED AND FOR MANY DAYS HE DID NOT DARE TO GO HOME AGAIN FOR HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE OLD WOMAN WOULD SLAY HIM OUTRIGHT
I AM COMING
I AM COMING
NOW WHEN THE PRINCESS WAS LEFT ALONE SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND MOAN IN A WAY THAT WAS PITIFUL TO HEAR
THEY WERE DRIVING THEIR SPURS INTO THE PARTITION TILL THE SPLINTERS FLEW ABOUT AND SOME OF THE BOYS FELL OFF AND SOME STILL HUNG ON AND SAT LOOKING LIKE FOOLS
NEVERTHELESS SHE WORE ROUGE AND PATCHES A MANTLE OF SILVER BROCADE AND A CROWN OF DIAMONDS AND HER DRESS WAS COVERED WITH JEWELS AND GREEN AND PINK RIBBONS
I SEE YOU DO NOT THINK THE PRINCE HANDSOME BUT LOOK AT YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT SIRE SHE ANSWERED I DO NOT WISH TO COMPLAIN ONLY I BEG OF YOU DO NOT MAKE ME MARRY AT ALL
JUST AS SHE WAS PULLING THE KNOT TIGHT THERE WAS A CRACK AND THE THREAD BROKE FOR IT WAS ROTTEN
SIRE WE HAVE COME FROM VERY FAR AWAY TO SHOW YOU A BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT SO SAYING THEY DREW FROM THEIR TRAVELLING BAG THE PICTURE OF ROSETTE
IT WAS THE MOTHER
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE WOOD SHE SAW A LITTLE HOUSE AND OUT OF IT PEEPED THREE LITTLE DWARFS
GOOD-BYE MADAM
BY THIS TIME HER GUARDS WERE SEEKING HER EVERYWHERE AND THEY WERE AMAZED TO FIND HER UP IN THE TURRET FOR THEY SAID SHE COULD ONLY HAVE GOT THERE BY MAGIC
AND VERY BRISK AND ACTIVE HE WAS AND THE HORSES THAT HE LOOKED AFTER WERE SO FAT AND SLEEK THAT THEY SHONE AGAIN
SO THAT THEY MAY NOT BE UNDER THE POWER OR JURISDICTION OF ANY OTHER WOMAN
ONE DAY SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO TELL EVERYTHING TO HER ELDEST SISTER
BUT WHEN THE MAN HAD PLUCKED THE THIRD FARMER WEATHERBEARD SCREAMED SO LOUDLY THAT THE MAN THOUGHT THAT BRICK AND MORTAR WOULD BE RENT IN TWAIN BUT FOR ALL THAT HE WENT ON SLEEPING
THIS HORSE WAS DAPPLED TOO AND SO LIKE DAPPLEGRIM THAT NO ONE COULD DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
IT WAS JUST AT THIS MOMENT THAT THE QUEEN AND THE FAIRY ARRIVED IN THE FLYING CHARIOT AND THE QUEEN WAS DREADFULLY DISTRESSED AT THE TURN AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN AND SAID MISERABLY THAT SHE WAS DESTINED TO BE UNFORTUNATE ALL HER DAYS
SO THEY WENT THERE TOGETHER AND THE PRINCESS WAS CHARMED WITH THE OLD WOMAN AND EVERYTHING BELONGING TO HER
AND HIS WIFE CALLED HER MAID TO HER AND SAID LET US CHANGE CLOTHES AND YOU SHALL BE CALLED BY MY NAME AND I BY YOURS LEST THE ENEMY FINDS US SO THIS WAS DONE AND THEY HID IN A WOOD BUT THERE SOME STRANGERS MET THEM AND CARRIED THEM OFF IN A SHIP TO DENMARK
SO THE WAITING-MAID WENT HOME AND TOLD THE QUEEN
NOW YOU MAY CHOOSE AH WELL SAID THE PRINCESS I SUPPOSE ONE CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING AND IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER TO BE GOOD THAN PRETTY AND SO SHE BREATHED UPON THE WHITE SIDE OF THE MUFF AND THANKED THE OLD FAIRY WHO IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
SO THE OLD WOMAN GAVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF A SHIP WHICH WAS NO BIGGER THAN HE COULD PUT IN HIS POCKET AND THEN SHE GOT HER EYE BACK AND SHE WENT HER WAY AND MINNIKIN HIS
LASTLY HE WENT ROUND THE CASTLE AND PLUNGED INTO THE ORANGE GROVE
YOU MUST GET HIM SUCH A GOOD PLACE THAT HE WILL BECOME MASTER OF ALL MASTERS SHE SAID AND THEN SHE PUT SOME FOOD AND A ROLL OF TOBACCO INTO A BAG FOR THEM
WHEN THE SQUARE WAS QUITE FULL THE BAGPIPER FACED ABOUT AND STILL PLAYING BRISKLY TURNED TOWARDS THE RIVER THAT RUNS AT THE FOOT OF THE WALLS OF HAMEL
WHETHER IT WAS THE HEN-WIFE INSTRUCTED HER OR WHETHER IT WAS FROM HER OWN KNOWLEDGE I CANNOT TELL
IT IS I SAID THE PRINCESS
PRINCE IVAN REPLIED
FROM THERE HE COMES BACK HERE SHE THEN TOLD THE PRINCESS THAT SHE HAD ASKED ABOUT HER HUS-BAND BUT THAT HER SON HAD REPLIED THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM AND THAT HER ONLY HOPE WAS TO GO AND INQUIRE OF THE WIND
YES FATED IT IS SAID THE KING
NOW YOU ARE TO TRY ON THE GOLD SHOE AND BE A PRINCESS SAID THE OTHER SERVANTS AND THEY LAUGHED AT HER AND MOCKED HER
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT HE HAD TO GO OUT TO BATTLE SO HE CALLED HIS DAUGHTERS AND SAID TO THEM
MY DEAR CHILD IT IS FAR TOO COLD
IS IT SIGURD SIGMUND'S SON WHO HAS BROKEN THE CURSE AND COMES HERE TO WAKEN ME AT LAST THIS CURSE CAME UPON HER WHEN THE THORN OF THE TREE OF SLEEP RAN INTO HER HAND LONG AGO AS A PUNISHMENT BECAUSE SHE HAD DISPLEASED ODIN THE GOD
INDEED IT IS SO THE FAIRY SAID
WHEN THE YOUTH REACHED HOME AGAIN ANYONE CAN IMAGINE WHAT A STATE OF MIND HE WAS IN
NO SAID THE OLD WOMAN
NO SAID THE OLD WOMAN
NO SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THE TROLL HAD NINE HEADS SHE TOLD HIM
SO SHE PRESENTLY WENT AWAY FROM THE COURT TO HER OWN CASTLE WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF
THE GATE WILL OPEN OF ITSELF HE CONTINUED AND A HUGE DOG WHICH GUARDS THE CASTLE WILL COME TO YOU WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN BUT JUST THROW HIM THIS OAT CAKE
IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE CASTLE THERE IS A PIG-STY WHERE YOU SHALL DWELL
WHENEVER SHE HEARD THE WITCH'S VOICE SHE UNLOOSED HER PLAITS AND LET HER HAIR FALL DOWN OUT OF THE WINDOW ABOUT TWENTY YARDS BELOW AND THE OLD WITCH CLIMBED UP BY IT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK IS A CASTLE WHERE DWELLS A HORRIBLE WITCH WHO ALLOWS NO LIVING BEING TO ENTER THE DOORS
AHEM
OH NO DEAR FRIEND DON'T SHOOT
I MUST TRY AND FIND ANOTHER COMPANION SO HE TOOK OUT HIS FIDDLE AND PLAYED AS MERRILY AS BEFORE
THE DOOR-POST WAS TARRED AND IT STUCK FAST AND EVEN HAD YOU LOST TWO OF THEM ANSWERED HER MOTHER I WOULD GIVE YOU FINER ONES THEN THE GIRL HASTENED HOME AND WHEN HER FATHER CAME HOME FROM THE FEAST WITH THE WITCH SHE WAS IN HER USUAL PLACE BEHIND THE STOVE
I'M HERE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK I SHAN'T OPEN THE DOOR SO OFF SPRANG THE LITTLE ROE AND HE FELT QUITE WELL AND HAPPY IN THE FREE OPEN AIR
WHEN MIDNIGHT CAME AND EVERYONE IN THE PALACE WAS SOUND ASLEEP THE NURSE WHO ALONE WATCHED BY THE BABY'S CRADLE IN THE NURSERY SAW THE DOOR OPEN GENTLY AND WHO SHOULD COME IN BUT THE REAL QUEEN
THEN SHE ADDED THE OTHER BONES TILL SHE HAD TWO LONG POLES THE HEIGHT OF THE HOUSE
BUT YOU MUST FIRST HAVE ME WELL SHOD
GOOD EVENING MOTHER SAID THE YOUTH
AND SO SHE WENT IN HER SORE TROUBLE TO THE BIRCH TREE ON HER MOTHER'S GRAVE AND CRIED AND CRIED BECAUSE HER MOTHER LAY DEAD BENEATH THE SOD AND COULD HELP HER NO LONGER
HAIL PRINCE IVAN
HAIL PRINCE IVAN
HAIL PRINCE IVAN
TELL ME PRINCESS WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WISH FOR MOST
SO HE WALKED AND HE RODE AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE WOOD WOULD NEVER COME TO AN END
THEY ARE HOLDING MY DRESS YOU FOOLISH THING SAID HER ELDEST SISTER YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID OF SOMETHING
I THEN BEGAN TO THINK THAT MY DEATH WAS INEVITABLE CONSIDERING THAT THOSE WHO WERE CAPABLE OF DOING SO MUCH WOULD SOON END MY LIFE
GO AND TELL THE KING TO SWING HIS SWORD THREE TIMES OVER ME ON THE THRESHOLD THE SCULLION DID AS THE CREATURE BADE HIM AND THE KING CAME WITH HIS SWORD AND SWUNG IT THREE TIMES OVER THE BIRD AND LO AND BEHOLD
HIS NAME WAS GRANI AND HE CAME OF SLEIPNIR'S BREED AND WAS THE BEST HORSE IN THE WORLD
KOSHCHEI REPLIED
BUT IF EVER YOU FALL INTO ANY NEED OR TROUBLE SAID THE ELDER CALL ME THRICE AND I WILL COME AND HELP YOU
AND NOW SHE NOTICED THAT EVERY NIGHT THE PIG BECAME A MAN AND EVERY MORNING HE WAS CHANGED INTO A PIG BEFORE SHE AWOKE
BUT JACK WAS VERY NIMBLE
THERE WAS A NICE LITTLE GARDEN ATTACHED TO THE COTTAGE IN WHICH THEY CULTIVATED PEAS BEANS AND CABBAGES AND THE LADY WAS NOT ASHAMED TO GO OUT AT HARVEST TIME AND GLEAN IN THE FIELDS TO SUPPLY HER LITTLE SON'S WANTS
IX THEY DANCED ON TILL THE SHOES OF THE PRINCESSES WERE WORN INTO HOLES
EVERYONE WENT OUT TO MEET HIM WITH CYMBALS AND FIFES AND DRUMS AND THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING OVER HIS VICTORIOUS RETURN
THEN MINNIKIN SAID
IT WAS NIGHT THE SKY WAS SPARKLING WITH STARS AND THE EARTH WAS COVERED WITH A HEAVY DEW
DIRECTLY JACK PERCEIVED THAT THE GIANT WAS FAST ASLEEP HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF THE WARDROBE AND CREPT OUT
FIT FOR A STRAIT WAISTCOAT CRIED THE GOOD MAN WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK
THEN SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE BEGAN TO DANCE AND THE MAN GOT LEAVE TO STAY IN HER HOUSE
THE OLD WOMAN HAD RISEN EARLY TO SELL HERBS IN THE TOWN AND SHE HAD GONE OFF IN SUCH HASTE THAT SHE HAD LEFT HER BED UNMADE WITH HER GREAT NIGHT-CAP ON THE PILLOW
HOW LUCKY WE WERE TO ESCAPE I ONLY TRUST THAT WE MAY ESCAPE CATS AND TRAPS AND REACH THE GOLDEN BRANCH SOON SAID THE FAT MOUSE
THEN HE LET THE HORSE LOOSE AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP BUT BEFORE HE DID THAT HE TOOK HIS BAG OFF THE HORSE
THEN YOU ARE ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT MY SEVEN FOALS EAT AND DRINK SAID THE KING
BUT IF YOU ONLY HAVE THE COURAGE TO MARRY ME I SHALL GET BACK MY BEAUTY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
YES SAID THEY IF YOU HAVE A MIND TO TAKE TO THE TRADE THAT WE FOLLOW YOU MAY HAVE A PLACE HERE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT TRADE I FOLLOW SAID THE YOUTH FOR WHEN I CAME AWAY FROM HOME MY FATHER GAVE ME LEAVE TO TAKE TO ANY TRADE I FANCIED HAVE YOU A FANCY FOR STEALING THEN SAID THE ROBBERS
INDEED THOUGH SHE WAS THE MOST AMIABLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD THERE WAS NO CONCEALING THE FACT THAT SHE WAS FRIGHTFUL AND SO LAME THAT SHE ALWAYS WENT ABOUT WITH A CRUTCH AND PEOPLE CALLED HER PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK
NOW THOUGH THE PRINCESS SUNBEAM APPEARED TO BE ONLY A POOR SHEPHERDESS SHE NEVER FORGOT THAT SHE WAS A REAL PRINCESS AND SHE WAS NOT AT ALL SURE THAT SHE OUGHT TO MARRY A HUMBLE SHEPHERD THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE WOULD LIKE TO DO SO VERY MUCH
YOU MIGHT SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE OVER THAT WITHOUT DOING ANY GOOD BUT AS YOU ARE YOUNG AND QUITE THE PRETTIEST CREATURE I HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME I WILL MARRY YOU IF YOU LIKE AND I WILL GIVE YOU THOSE CATS AND MICE THAT YOU SEE THERE FOR YOUR OWN
HE IS CALLED THE KING I AM CALLED THE PRINCE AND THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF OUR SISTER THE PRINCESS ROSETTE
ARRIVED AT HOME SHE TOOK OFF HER CLOTHES BY THE BIRCH TREE LEFT HER HORSE STANDING THERE AND HASTENED TO HER PLACE BEHIND THE STOVE
HIS BROTHERS FORBADE US TO SAY THAT HE WAS ALIVE THREATENING TO SLAY US IF WE DID THEN THE KING WAS WROTH WITH THOSE SONS AND PUNISHED THEM AS HE THOUGHT BEST
GOLD SHALL DROP FROM HER HAIR WHENEVER SHE BRUSHES IT SAID THE SECOND
AND WHEN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT THE GLOVE AND WANTED TO GIVE IT BACK TO HER SHE SAID
THE PARENTS ALWAYS HOPED THEY WERE NOT DEAD AND THAT THE RAT-CATCHER WHO CERTAINLY MUST HAVE COME OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM WITH HIM TO HIS COUNTRY
YOU WILL FIND SOME SUGAR ALMONDS AND SOME TARTS THERE BUT DON'T BE SILLY ENOUGH TO OFFER FANFARONADE ANY AND THIS TIME THE PRINCESS WHO WAS FAINTING WITH HUNGER TOOK THE NIGHTINGALE'S ADVICE AND ATE WHAT SHE FOUND ALL BY HERSELF
AND NOW THE KING CAME HOME AND HE HAD CONQUERED THE OTHER KING WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN AT WAR
DON'T WASTE ANOTHER THOUGHT UPON THAT LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WHO IS UNWORTHY OF YOUR NOTICE
IT IS HE WHO DELIVERED ME FROM THE TROLL AND HE IS THE ONE WHOM I WILL HAVE RITTER RED SWORE THAT HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD SAVED HER BUT THE KING SAID
WHILE HE SPOKE THE KING FOR THE FIRST TIME LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT THE PRINCESS BECAUSE HE WAS SORRY TO SEE HOW SHE CRIED AND WHEN HE HEARD THE OLD MAN SAYING THAT HER NAME WAS ROSETTE AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN TREACHEROUSLY THROWN INTO THE SEA HE TURNED HEAD OVER HEELS THREE TIMES WITHOUT STOPPING IN SPITE OF BEING QUITE WEAK FROM HUNGER AND RAN TO EMBRACE HER AND UNTIED THE ROPES WHICH BOUND HER WITH HIS OWN HANDS DECLARING THAT HE LOVED HER WITH ALL HIS HEART
BUT SHE SAID TO THEM VERY POLITELY
I TOO HAVE BEEN FEELING VERY WARM DURING THE BALL SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THE GARDENER'S BOY BUT SHE NEVER SAW HIM
NO SAID THE MAN I WILL NOT FORGET WHEN HE GOT TO THE MARKET HE RECEIVED THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT FARMER WEATHERBEARD TREATED HIM SO HANDSOMELY THAT HE QUITE FORGOT TO TAKE OFF THE HALTER
THEY CALLED OUT TO HER TO ENTER SO SHE STEPPED IN AND SAT DOWN ON A SEAT BY THE FIRE WISHING TO WARM HERSELF AND EAT HER BREAKFAST
WE HAVE COME TO ASK IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MARRY HER
LIMPING ACROSS AT HER UTMOST SPEED SHE THREW THE WINDOW OPEN AND THE GREAT EAGLE SAILED IN BEATING WITH HIS WINGS FOR JOY
HE WAS SO IMPATIENT THAT HE WAS ALWAYS FULL FIFTY YARDS IN FRONT OF THE LORDS AND LADIES SENT BY TUBBY TO BRING BACK ZIZI
WELL YOU CAN SEE WHAT KIND OF QUEEN MINE IS BUT I CAN'T SEE YOURS
AND I REQUEST AND COMMAND ACCORDING TO MY BARGAIN THAT THE QUEEN SHALL STAND ON THE HIGHEST TOWER OF THE PALACE UNTIL WE COME BACK OR FIND OUT THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY DEAD WITH NOTHING BUT SHEAF CORN FOR HER FOOD AND COLD WATER FOR HER DRINK IF IT SHOULD BE FOR SEVEN YEARS AND LONGER ALL THINGS BEING NOW FIXED THE THREE PRINCES DEPARTED THE COURT IN SEARCH OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN'S PALACE AND TRAVELLING ALONG THE ROAD THEY CAME UP WITH A MAN WHO WAS A LITTLE LAME AND SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT ADVANCED IN YEARS
BUT HE WAS A VERY PERSEVERING BOY AND HE KNEW THAT THE WAY TO SUCCEED IN ANYTHING IS NOT TO GIVE UP
HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS SO FAINT AND GIDDY WITH HUNGER THAT HE HAD IMAGINED HE SAW AND HEARD ALL SORTS OF STRANGE THINGS
WELL SAYS THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN IF THAT'S THE CASE I BESTOW YOU MY STEED RATHER THAN THIS BRAVE FELLOW SHOULD DIE
PERHAPS WHEN YOU HAVE HURT YOURSELF YOU MAY LEARN TO KNOW BETTER HIS MOTHER ONLY GAVE HIM A VERY PLAIN CAKE MADE WITH WATER AND BAKED IN THE CINDERS AND A BOTTLE OF SOUR BEER
THE CINDER WENCH IS NOT HERE SAID THE PRINCE AT LAST
WHEN MINNIKIN CAME THE TROLL ASKED IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD BREW A HUNDRED LASTS OF MALT AT ONE BREWING
THE NORKA ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN
THEY CHRISTENED EACH OTHER AND THEN WENT ONWARDS
AS SOON AS SHE REDUCED TO ASHES THE SPELL WAS TAKEN OFF THE LITTLE ROE AND HE WAS RESTORED TO HIS NATURAL SHAPE ONCE MORE AND SO BROTHER AND SISTER LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.(6 6 GRIMM
OH SAID THE PRIEST IF YOU ARE AN ANGEL FROM HEAVEN DO LET ME OUT AND LET ME GO BACK TO EARTH AGAIN FOR NO PLACE WAS EVER SO BAD AS THIS--THE LITTLE FIENDS NIP ME SO WITH THEIR TONGS I AM NO ANGEL SAID THE GIRL AND HELPED THE PRIEST OUT OF THE SACK
JACK'S MOTHER SHRANK BACK AND IT WAS WELL SHE DID SO FOR JUST AS THE GIANT TOOK HOLD OF THE LAST BRANCH OF THE BEANSTALK JACK CUT THE STEM QUITE THROUGH AND DARTED FROM THE SPOT
AND WHERE MAY YOU BE GOING GAMMER GRASSHOPPER WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOURSELF GAFFER CRICKET REPLIED THE GRASSHOPPER
AFTER WHICH SHE FLOWED GROWLING INTO THE HALL OF THE PALACE TO THE HEIGHT OF MORE THAN FOUR FEET
BUT THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS DID NOT WANT TO GO NEAR THE TABLE OR TO OPEN THE BOOK
I AM NOT QUITE CERTAIN SAID THE MAN BUT I THINK I SEE SOMETHING COMING IN THE FAR DISTANCE THEN WE SHALL DO WELL TO FLY ON A LITTLE FARTHER SAID THE EAGLE AND AWAY IT WENT
I AM A PRINCESS SHE ANSWERED AND AM SEEKING FOR MY TWELVE BROTHERS
SO HE ADVANCED AND BLEW THE HORN WHICH HUNG AT THE CASTLE PORTAL
IT WAS NOT TILL MUCH LATER THAT ANYTHING WAS TO BE HEARD OF THEM
WHY SHOULD NOT WE GO INTO THE ROOM THAT OUR FATHER FORBAD US TO ENTER SISTER SAID THE YOUNGEST I CANNOT THINK HOW YOU CAN TEMPT US TO BREAK OUR FATHER'S COMMAND
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING THEN SIGURD REMEMBERED HOW THE STORY WENT THAT SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LADY ENCHANTED
CERTAINLY BEAUTY IS SHORT-LIVED AND THIS FUNNY LITTLE FACE AND A GREEN CRAPE DRESS ARE A COMICAL END TO IT
WHEN THEY HAD WALKED FOR SOME TIME THEY CAME TO A CROSSWAY AND THERE THEY AGREED TO PART AND EACH TAKE HIS OWN ROAD
I FOUND BY THEIR DISCOURSE THAT EVERYBODY HAD GOT MY NAME INTO THEIR MOUTH THOUGH I KEPT SILENT AS DEATH DURING THEIR DISCOURSE
IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF YOU HELD THEM IN YOUR HANDS SAID THE YOUNG MAN AND THEN PUT YOUR LEGS ONE AFTER THE OTHER IN EACH HOLE DEAR ME TO BE SURE
I ONLY WISH I COULD GET YOUR DAUGHTER AS EASILY SO LATE AT NIGHT THE MASTER THIEF WENT AND CUT DOWN A THIEF WHO WAS HANGING ON THE GALLOWS LAID HIM ON HIS OWN SHOULDERS AND TOOK HIM AWAY WITH HIM
WHEN SHE HAD GATHERED THEM ALL UP INTO A HEAP SHE WENT ON HER WAY AGAIN AND CAME AT LENGTH TO A LITTLE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH SAT AN OLD WOMAN
THEN THE SECOND SON PLAYED AND SHE WON THAT GAME LIKEWISE
BUT IF I GIVE BIRTH TO A LITTLE DAUGHTER I WILL WAVE A RED FLAG WHICH WILL WARN YOU TO FLY AWAY AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND MAY THE KIND HEAVEN HAVE PITY ON YOU
THEY HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO GET THE PRINCESS READY WHEN A DWARF ARRIVED MOUNTED UPON AN ELEPHANT
I AM VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH YOUR GENEROUS FEELING SHE SAID
BUT I MUST HAVE MORE TROLLS TO HELP TO CARRY WHAT IS WANTED SAID MINNIKIN
STAY WITH ME AND BE MY LITTLE MAID AND IF YOU DO YOUR WORK WELL I WILL REWARD YOU HANDSOMELY
COME AND LET US SEE IF WE CAN GET HOLD OF IT SO OUT HE WENT AND THE OTHERS WITH HIM AND AWAY WENT THE HARE AND THEY AFTER IT IN REAL EARNEST
FOR HE IS WITHIN TWO OR THREE MINUTES OF HIS LATTER END BUT SAYS THE BLACK THIEF I WAS WITHIN ONE MOMENT OF MY DEATH AND I AM HERE YET HOW WAS THAT SAYS THE KNIGHT
AT LENGTH THIS ROYAL ASSEMBLY BEGAN TO SPORT AND PLAY AT ALL KINDS OF DIVERSIONS AND THE QUEEN VERY CUNNINGLY CHALLENGED THE THREE PRINCES TO PLAY AT CARDS WITH HER MAKING BARGAIN WITH THEM AS SHE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED
SO THEY THOUGHT AND THOUGHT BUT THEY COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO DO UNTIL AT LAST THE QUEEN HEARD THAT IN A GREAT FOREST NEAR THE CASTLE THERE WAS AN OLD HERMIT WHO LIVED IN A HOLLOW TREE AND THAT PEOPLE CAME FROM FAR AND NEAR TO CONSULT HIM
NEVERTHELESS HE REMEMBERED SHORTLY WHAT HE HAD COME FOR TO THE PALACE AND IMPROVING THE OCCASION HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT FOR HIS DEAR MONEY
THE DWARFS SAID AT ONCE
AS HE DREW NEAR IT HE HEARD SOMEONE SINGING SO SWEETLY THAT HE STOOD STILL SPELL-BOUND AND LISTENED
WE ARE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST
I MUST LOSE NO TIME IN GETTING RID OF HIM BUT HOW WHY BY HAVING HIM TAKEN TO THE TOWER WITH THE DUNGEONS OF COURSE FOR THIS WAS THE WAY THAT IN OLD TIMES BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES GOT RID OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW TOO MUCH
IF ONLY THESE ORANGES WERE REAL FRUIT--FRUIT AS REFRESHING AS WHAT I ATE IN FLANDERS
HERE
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME HE ASKED THE PRETTY SPINNER
BUT FIRST HE DYED HIS HAIR AND DISGUISED HIMSELF
NOW THAT WE ARE THE MASTERS LET US TAKE OUR SISTER OUT OF THAT DULL TOWER WHICH SHE IS SO TIRED OF THEY HAD ONLY TO GO ACROSS THE GARDEN TO REACH THE TOWER WHICH WAS VERY HIGH AND STOOD UP IN A CORNER
THE TURKEY-MAIDEN ANSWERED PROUDLY
IF ONE HAD BUT A LITTLE TOBACCO SAID A THIRD
THITHER SHALL YOU GO SAID THE BULL
AN HOUR LATER THE REAL GOVERNOR RETURNED
THE MARES ARE AT HOME NOW THE PRINCE AROSE AND RETURNED HOME
INDEED WHEN SHE HUMBLY ASKED FOR SOME HE SAID MOCKINGLY THAT IT WAS TOO SWEET FOR HER AND WOULD SPOIL HER TEETH
WHEN THE GOVERNOR LEARNT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE PRIEST HE LAUGHED TILL HE NEARLY KILLED HIMSELF BUT WHEN THE MASTER THIEF CAME AND WANTED TO HAVE HIS DAUGHTER ACCORDING TO PROMISE HE ONCE MORE GAVE HIM NOTHING BUT FINE WORDS AND SAID YOU MUST GIVE ME ONE MORE PROOF OF YOUR SKILL SO THAT I CAN REALLY JUDGE OF YOUR WORTH
AND HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS CRYING
BE OFF WITH YOU AT ONCE AND DON'T SHOW YOUR FACE AGAIN TILL YOU HAVE FILLED THE BASKET WITH STRAWBERRIES THEN SHE GAVE HER A HARD CRUST OF BREAD SAYING
THE KING HAD THEM BOTH ARRESTED AT ONCE AND BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND THEY WERE CONDEMNED TO DEATH
WHILE THE PRINCESS WAS STILL LOOKING AFTER HIM IN HORROR HER ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A RUSHING NOISE OVER HER HEAD AND LOOKING UP SHE SAW TWO CHARIOTS APPROACHING RAPIDLY FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
TRULY SAID SHE A KIND ACTION NEVER GOES UNREWARDED
SO AFTER RESTING FOR A MOMENT HE WENT ON
PRESENTLY HE CAME UP WITH THE BEAST AND THEY BEGAN A FIGHT
SO HE TOO LIKE THE OTHERS HAD BEEN FORCED AGAINST HIS WILL TO FOLLOW THE VOICE THAT CALLED HIM
NO I SHAN'T LET YOU GO AGAIN
THOU ART STILL FAR TOO LITTLE BUT THE LITTLE CREATURE WAS DETERMINED TO DO IT AND BEGGED AND PRAYED SO LONG THAT THE MOTHER WAS FORCED TO LET HIM HAVE SOME OLD RAGS AND TIE UP A LITTLE FOOD FOR HIM AND THEN GAILY AND HAPPILY HE WENT OUT INTO THE WORLD
THAT WAS NEATLY DONE SAID THE GYPSY
AND THEN WHO WAS IT WHO SCOLDED HER WHEN SHE KNEW ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
ANOTHER YEAR WENT BY
GOOD MORNING DEAR BROTHER
SO HE WENT HOME AND TOOK THE THIRD OX AND DROVE IT OFF WITHOUT HIS WIFE KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT
INDEED I THINK THE EGGS ARE HEAVIER THAN EVER THE GIANTESS WENT AWAY AND SOON RETURNED WITH A LITTLE BROWN HEN WHICH SHE PLACED ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER HUSBAND
WHAT SHOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU PERCINET SAID GRACIOSA GRATEFULLY
CAN I SLEEP HERE AND HAVE SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT ASKED THE YOUTH
IN THE MORNING SNOWDROP AWOKE BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE SEVEN LITTLE DWARFS SHE FELT VERY FRIGHTENED
I WISH TO PROPOSE FOR YOUR SISTER THE PRINCESS MARYA IF YOU FIND FAVOUR IN THE EYES OF MY SISTER I WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH HER WISHES
YOU MAY TELL THEM THAT YOU HAVE A DESIRE TO TRY THESE THINGS AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE MEN IS TO HAVE THEM SO THE KING THANKED HIM AND WENT AND DID WHAT HE HAD SAID
IN THE MEANTIME MINNIKIN BEGGED THE KITCHEN-MAID VERY PRETTILY TO GIVE HIM LEAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE STRAND FOR A SHORT TIME
BUT THE UGLY OLD FAIRY ONLY GRUNTED AND MADE NO ANSWER
GIVE YOUR SISTERS IN MARRIAGE TO THE VERY FIRST SUITORS WHO COME TO WOO THEM
IT PLEASED THE GIRL SO MUCH THAT SHE LET HERSELF BE TAKEN IN AND OPENED THE DOOR
THIS HE PRESENTED TO THE PRINCE WHO GUESSED BY THIS TIME THAT HE WAS IN SOME WAY TO BREAK THE ENCHANTMENT THAT SURROUNDED THE SLEEPING LADY
THE MARVELLOUS MUSICIAN THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MARVELLOUS MUSICIAN
THE WOOD THAT YOU SAW IN YOUR DREAM IS NOT FAR FROM HERE SAID THE OLD MAN
IT WAS A LONG WAY TO THE CASTLE AND HE BOTH WALKED AND RAN TO GET THERE IN TIME
LET HER MARRY YOU IN GOD'S NAME THE PRINCESS MARYA GAVE HER CONSENT
BUT DO NOT FORGET TO TURN THE SHOES ROUND THE KING THANKED HIM PUT ON THE SHOES AND WHEN HE HAD GOT TO HIM WHO WAS LORD OF ALL THE FISH IN THE SEA HE TURNED THE SNOW SHOES ROUND AND BACK THEY WENT JUST AS THE OTHERS HAD GONE AND HE ASKED ONCE MORE WHERE WHITELAND WAS
DULLHEAD ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS TAKING SO MUCH TO HEART AND THE MAN ANSWERED
SO HE HASTENED TO DEPART FROM THE FATAL CASTLE AND SOUGHT SHELTER IN A HOLLOW TREE WHERE HE FOUND A FORLORN LOOKING LITTLE GRASSHOPPER CROUCHING IN A CORNER TOO MISERABLE TO SING
THERE THERE YOU ARE HOW
WHO'S BEEN TASTING MY PORRIDGE THE FOURTH SAID
DEAR BROTHER PRAY DON'T DRINK OR YOU'LL BE TURNED INTO A WILD BEAST AND TEAR ME TO PIECES BROTHER WAS DREADFULLY THIRSTY BUT HE DID NOT DRINK
THE PRINCESS ROSETTE'S PORTRAIT WAS CARRIED AT THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION AND AFTER IT WALKED THE KING SURROUNDED BY HIS COURTIERS
GET UP AND COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT AND HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE KING'S COURT
OUR TWO PRINCES--FOR THE THIRD ONE HAS DISAPPEARED--HAVE BROUGHT AWAY BRIDES FROM THE OTHER WORLD AND WANT TO MARRY THEM BUT THOSE BRIDES REFUSE
SUCH A BEAUTY AS MARYA MOREVNA ONE MIGHT SEARCH FOR ALL THE WORLD OVER--AND NEVER FIND ONE LIKE HER AND SO THEY VISITED AND THEY FEASTED
NOT FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD GOT OFF THE BEANSTALK STOOD A FINE STRONG CASTLE
UNHAPPILY HE DID NOT DARE TO COME FORWARD BEING AFRAID THAT HE SHOULD ONLY BE JEERED AT OR EVEN TURNED AWAY FROM THE CASTLE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS IMPUDENCE
PERHAPS SHE MAY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
THE PRINCE'S HORSE AWOKE HIM
NO WONDER THE YOUNG LADIES THOUGHT HIM VERY ODD BUT THEY LIKED HIM ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT
THE PIG WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH MERE PROMISES BUT INSISTED THAT THE WEDDING SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN A WEEK AND WOULD NOT GO AWAY TILL THE KING HAD SWORN A ROYAL OATH UPON IT
I'LL EAT THE WHITE CHEEK AND YOU CAN EAT THE RED BUT THE APPLE WAS SO CUNNINGLY MADE THAT ONLY THE RED CHEEK WAS POISONOUS
BUT HARDLY HAD THE FIRST BITE PASSED HER LIPS THAN SHE FELL DOWN DEAD ON THE GROUND
THEN HE THREW A LOCK OF WOOL INTO THE RIVER AND WHEN IT FLOATED DOWN AGAINST THE SWORD IT WAS CUT INTO TWO PIECES
AS SHE WAS ALWAYS BEING TEASED ABOUT HER COMPLEXION SHE GOT AS NOISY AND CROSS AS A TITMOUSE
TEN YEARS LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE IN TORMENT NEITHER EATING NOR DRINKING
THEN HE CARESSED GRACIOSA AND MADE HER SIT DOWN TO SUPPER WITH HIM AND THEY WERE AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE
ONLY LISTEN
SHE WAS THEN PERCHED ON THE TOP OF A MAGNIFICENT AMBLING PALFREY AND THEY SET FORTH TO THE CASTLE
FANFARONADE WAS NOT GENERALLY AT A LOSS FOR SOMETHING TO SAY BUT WHEN HE SAW THE PRINCESS SHE WAS SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MAJESTIC THAN HE HAD EXPECTED THAT HE COULD ONLY STAMMER OUT A FEW WORDS AND ENTIRELY FORGOT THE HARANGUE WHICH HE HAD BEEN LEARNING FOR MONTHS AND KNEW WELL ENOUGH TO HAVE REPEATED IT IN HIS SLEEP
GOOD-MORNING MY FINE SCULLION GOOD-MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE SCULLION WHOM THE MASTER COOK HAD FORGOTTEN IN HIS EXCITEMENT TO WARN
SHE WISHED THEM GOOD-DAY AND KNOCKED MODESTLY AT THE DOOR
BUT AS SOON AS SHE WAS SAFELY OUT SHE BEGAN TO BE RATHER SORRY FOR HERSELF
AT THIS CARABOSSE LAUGHED MALICIOUSLY AND CLIMBED AWAY UP THE CHIMNEY LEAVING THEM ALL IN GREAT CONSTERNATION AND ESPECIALLY THE QUEEN
PRESENTLY SHE SAID
SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER GATHERING FRUIT AND FLOWERS AND HER LITTLE DOG FRISK WHO WAS BRIGHT GREEN ALL OVER AND HAD BUT ONE EAR DANCED BEFORE HER CRYING BOW-WOW-WOW AND TURNING HEAD OVER HEELS IN THE MOST ENCHANTING WAY
PLAY SOMETHING MERRIER SAID THE GIANT
I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART THAT YOU WERE BACK IN YOUR DARK TOWER AGAIN DARLING DON'T BE CROSS SAID THE PRINCESS
THE PRINCESSES HAD MADE THEM DRINK SOMETHING OF A PHILTRE WHICH FROZE THE HEART AND LEFT NOTHING BUT THE LOVE OF DANCING
STAY DEAR LOVE STAY SHE CRIED
EARLY IN THE MORNING HIS MASTER AWOKE AND BEHOLD
LET US BE OFF AFTER THIS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING FANFARONADE FOR WITH OUT A DOUBT HE HAS RUN AWAY WITH OUR PRINCESS THEN THERE WAS A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS AND EVERYBODY SHOUTED BY ALL MEANS LET US BE AFTER HIM SO WHILE SOME EMBARKED UPON THE SEA THE OTHERS RAN FROM KINGDOM TO KINGDOM BEATING DRUMS AND BLOWING TRUMPETS AND WHEREVER A CROWD COLLECTED THEY CRIED
DEAR MOTHER DO NOT CUT ME SO ARE YOU HERE DEMANDED THE WITCH
I WAS THEN VERY SORRY THAT I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO KILL HIM BUT IT THEN COULD NOT BE HELPED
GOOD LET US DO SO THE DAUGHTER HOWEVER HAD OVERHEARD THEIR TALK AND SHE RAN TO THE FLOCK AND LAMENTED ALOUD
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT A GREAT FESTIVAL WAS TO BE HELD AT THE PALACE AND THE KING HAD COMMANDED THAT ALL THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVITED AND THAT THIS PROCLAMATION SHOULD BE MADE
I SHALL GET THERE BEFORE YOU NO DOUBT WITH YOUR LITTLE BITS OF LEGS AND I'LL TELL HER YOU'RE COMING TO SEE HER
IT IS HE NOW THAT IS CAUGHT SWALLOWED LIKE A LETTER IN THE POST
TOC
WHEN THE SWEET-WORT WAS READY THEY WERE ALL AS A MATTER OF COURSE ANXIOUS TO TASTE IT FIRST THE TROLL HIMSELF AND THEN THE OTHERS
I AM WEARY OF MY LIFE
THE KING WHO WAS VERY MUCH ASTONISHED SAID HE SHOULD LIKE TO GO AND SEE FOR HIMSELF
BUT WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE COURT AND THE WHOLE STREET WERE FULL OF ALL THE PIGS IN THE WORLD HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ESCAPE AND THAT HE MUST GIVE HIS CONSENT
SO SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD TAKE GREAT CARE NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING AND HE SHOULD SEE THAT SHE DID
A WOMAN AS TALL AS A GIANT WAS LEANING OVER THE OVEN
AND BESIDES IT DEPENDS ON ME TO BREAK THE SPELL AND I LOVE HER TOO MUCH TO LET HER REMAIN LIKE THIS SO HE PRESENTED THE GYPSY TO THE LORDS AND LADIES OF THE COURT EXPLAINING TO THEM THE TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE
NEXT DAY SHE TOLD GUNNAR HER HUSBAND THAT HE WAS A COWARD AND A LIAR FOR HE HAD NEVER RIDDEN THE FLAME BUT HAD SENT SIGURD TO DO IT FOR HIM AND PRETENDED THAT HE HAD DONE IT HIMSELF
ONE DAY THE WOMAN STOOD AT THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN AND SAW THERE A BED FULL OF THE FINEST RAMPION
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ONE OF THE KING'S PAGES I AM NOT IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING MADAM ANSWERED HE BUT IN YOURS IN MINE SAID THE PRINCESS WITH GREAT SURPRISE
SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF HER FATHER'S WORDS AND PULLING OUT HER POCKET HANDKERCHIEF SHE GENTLY WIPED THE PIG'S SNOUT AND KISSED IT
MY SISTER DEAR OPEN
WHEN SHE HAD BEEN DRESSED BY THE FOUR-AND-TWENTY MAIDENS IN A CHARMING ROBE WHICH THE QUEEN HAD SENT FOR HER AND IN WHICH SHE LOOKED PRETTIER THAN EVER PRINCE PERCINET CAME TO SEE HER AND WAS BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN SHE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THINKING
AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BLACK AS EBONY THIS TIME THE DWARFS WON'T BE ABLE TO BRING YOU BACK TO LIFE WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE ASKED THE MIRROR
WE MUST ENTER THE CASTLE WITH MORE CEREMONY
BUT AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BUSHY BRIDE AGAIN BEGAN TO CROON AND TO SING SO THAT HIS EYES BEGAN TO CLOSE AND HIS HEAD TO DROOP ON ONE SIDE
VERY NEAR THE WATER THERE WAS A PRETTY GREEN BANK AND THERE THE PRINCESSES SAID THEY WOULD SIT DOWN AND WHILE AWAY AN HOUR FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SIT AND LOOK OUT OVER THE WATER THEY SAID
THEY CARRIED HER BACK TO THE PALACE AND PUT HER TO BED BUT AS SOON AS SHE RECOVERED ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK SHE BEGAN TO SCOLD AND RAGE AND DECLARED THAT THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS GRACIOSA'S FAULT THAT SHE HAD CONTRIVED IT ON PURPOSE TO TRY AND GET RID OF HER AND THAT IF THE KING WOULD NOT HAVE HER PUNISHED SHE WOULD GO BACK TO HER CASTLE AND ENJOY HER RICHES BY HERSELF
THEN THE OTTER SKIN WAS FILLED WITH GOLD AND COVERED WITH GOLD ALL BUT ONE HAIR AND THAT WAS COVERED WITH THE POOR DWARF'S LAST RING
THE NEXT DAY THE SECOND SON WENT AND DID JUST THE SAME
SO HE STRUGGLED TO BE BRAVE AND MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON THE MASTER THIEF CAME AND WANTED TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AS HE HAD PROMISED
IF YOU WILL RIDE INTO THAT WOOD AND SEARCH IT CAREFULLY TO SEE IF YOU CAN LIGHT UPON A FELLOW WHO IS HIDING IN THERE YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOAN OF MY HORSE AND A GOOD PRESENT OF MONEY FOR YOUR TROUBLE I AM NOT SURE THAT I CAN DO IT SAID THE MAN FOR I HAVE TO GO TO A WEDDING WITH THIS CASK OF MEAD WHICH I HAVE BEEN TO FETCH AND THE TAP HAS FALLEN OUT ON THE WAY SO NOW I HAVE TO KEEP MY FINGER IN THE TAP-HOLE AS I DRIVE OH JUST RIDE OFF SAID THE GOVERNOR AND I WILL LOOK AFTER THE CASK AND THE HORSE TOO SO THE MAN SAID THAT IF HE WOULD DO THAT HE WOULD GO BUT HE BEGGED THE GOVERNOR TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO PUT HIS FINGER INTO THE TAP-HOLE THE MOMENT HE TOOK HIS OUT
I'M SO HUNGRY I FEEL QUITE UNWELL PLEASE LET US ALONE PRINCE IVAN BEGS THE LIONESS
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE HE ASKED
THE VOICE OF DEATH ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A MAN WHOSE ONE WISH AND PRAYER WAS TO GET RICH
SHE PICKED IT UP AND AFTER A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION DECIDED THAT IT MUST BELONG TO THE CURIOUS OLD CABINET IN THE CORNER WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE KEYHOLE
SHE HAD LOST HER TRUE LOVE SIGURD THE SLAYER OF FAFNIR AND SHE WAS MARRIED TO A MAN WHO WAS A LIAR
HOWEVER I FOUND RUNNING WAS OF NO USE IN SAVING ME AS LONG AS I HAD THE RING ON MY FOOT
DRESS ME LIKE A PRINCE A BEAUTIFUL PINK FLOWER APPEARED
IT IS ALL THAT I CAN DO TO FIND CLOTHES AND BEDDING FOR MYSELF AND WRETCHED THEY ARE YOU WERE ALWAYS A HARD MAN SAID THE YOUTH AND HARD YOU ARE STILL IF YOU REFUSE TO LET YOUR OWN SON COME INTO YOUR HOUSE ARE YOU MY SON SAID THE MAN
SO THE LITTLE GIRL STOPS TO TALK WITH THE WOLF WHO FOR ALL THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST
THEN THERE WAS A SCURRYING HITHER AND THITHER AND A HUNTING EVERYWHERE
IT WILL BRING YOU GOOD FORTUNE WHEN THE YOUTH CAME TO THE FIRST PRINCESS SHE CALLED TO HIM AND BEGGED HIM TO COME TO HER VERY PRETTILY BUT HE WALKED ON AS IF HE DID NOT EVEN SEE HER AND HE PASSED BY THE SECOND IN THE SAME WAY BUT HE WENT UP TO THE THIRD
IT IS TOO LATE THEN SIGURD WAS SO GRIEVED AND HIS HEART SO SWELLED IN HIS BREAST THAT IT BURST THE STEEL RINGS OF HIS SHIRT OF MAIL
IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT YOU DID NOT SCREAM OUT WHEN YOU SAW ME AS THE OTHER BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE DID FOR IF YOU HAD DONE SO MY HUSBAND WOULD HAVE AWAKENED AND HAVE EATEN YOU AS HE DID THEM FOR BREAKFAST
NOW FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME THE FATHER IN WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST FOUND A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN DESERTED BY THE GYPSIES
THEY ALWAYS BROUGHT THEIR SPOILS HOME TO BENJAMIN WHO SOON LEARNT TO MAKE THEM INTO DAINTY DISHES
LASH HIM TO THE MAST AND GIVE HIM A TASTE OF THE CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS
DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDERLAD
AND SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL AND BENT HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY OF THE BRANCHES AND PUT THEM ASIDE WITH HER HANDS
WHAT A BAD LITTLE BEAST THAT MOUSE MUST BE
THEN SHE TOLD THE KING ALL THE CRUEL THINGS THE WICKED WITCH AND HER DAUGHTER HAD DONE
THE WEDDING WAS HELD AT ONCE AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER--EVEN TO FRISK WHO ENJOYED THE GREATEST LUXURY AND NEVER HAD ANYTHING WORSE THAN THE WING OF A PARTRIDGE FOR DINNER ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE.(7 7 MADAME D'AULNOY
ON AND ON SHE WANDERED OVER NINE SEAS AND ACROSS NINE CONTINENTS
SHE ALMOST DIED OF MISERY AND IF HER SISTERS HAD NOT HELD HER UP SHE WOULD HAVE SUNK TO THE GROUND AND CUT HER HEAD OPEN
THEY SOON FELL INTO DISCOURSE AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE PRINCES ASKED THE STRANGER HIS NAME OR WHAT WAS THE REASON HE WORE SO REMARKABLE A BLACK CAP AS HE SAW ON HIM
WELL ONE OF THEM HAD A LITTLE SO THEY SHARED IT AMONG THEM THOUGH THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FOR EACH MAN BUT THEY CHEWED IT
IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE UP THERE I MIGHT WARM MYSELF AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT THOUGHT HALVOR
IT IS MY OWN FAULT SHE SAID SADLY
SO SHE TOLD HIM WHERE THEY WERE
GO AND FIND THE AMBASSADOR FANFARONADE WHO IS DOUBTLESS ASLEEP IN SOME CORNER AND TELL HIM THE SAD NEWS SO THE PAGE HUNTED HITHER AND THITHER BUT FANFARONADE WAS NO MORE TO BE FOUND THAN THE PRINCESS THE DAGGER OR THE NECK-HANDKERCHIEF
THERE STOOD THE KING OUTSIDE ON THE STEPS AND HE ASKED WHITHER HE WAS BOUND
THEN HE WENT BACK AGAIN AFTER MARYA MOREVNA
BUT MINNIKIN ANSWERED THAT HE HAD BEEN HOME FOR A SHORT TIME AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THE HOOPS WHICH HAD FALLEN OFF SOME PAILS AND THAT HE HAD BROUGHT THEM AWAY FOR THE KITCHEN-MAID
LAST OF ALL WALKED DELICIA WHO WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT IT WAS NOTHING SHORT OF MARVELLOUS
THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE ROOM OF THE DUKE OF BELOEIL WHO HAD JUST AWOKE
THE FAIRY THEN CHANGED HERSELF BACK INTO THE FORM OF A MOUSE AND THIS DELAYED HER A FEW SECONDS AFTER WHICH SHE RAN NIMBLY DOWN THE STRAW ROPE BUT ONLY TO FIND WHEN SHE GOT TO THE BOTTOM THAT THE BABY HAD DISAPPEARED
PRESENTLY THERE CAME IN A LADY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN CAN BE IMAGINED ANYWHERE BUT IN A FAIRY TALE WHO SAID
THE DWARFS WHEN THEY HAD HEARD HER SAD STORY ASKED HER
BY THIS TIME THE KING HAD MISSED HIS DAGGER AND THE SEARCH BEGAN ALL OVER AGAIN
FEELING THAT WHILE SHE WAS SPINNING HE WAS DYING THE COUNT ORDERED THAT HER HANDS SHOULD BE TIED AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HER FOR ONE INSTANT
GREAT WAS THE REJOICING OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAW HIM AND HIS WIFE
ONE THING SHALT THOU PROMISE ME AND THAT IS TO DO WHAT THY FATHER BIDS THEE BUT NOT WHAT THY MOTHER BIDS THEE AND THIS HE PROMISED
AND THEY RAN AWAY AND THE YOUTH AFTER THEM JUST AS IT CHANCED OVER HILL AND DALE THROUGH WOODS END BOGS
LAY YOUR FRONT PAWS IN THIS CRACK THE WOLF DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND THE MUSICIAN QUICKLY SEIZED A STONE AND WEDGED BOTH HIS FORE PAWS SO FIRMLY INTO THE CRACK THAT HE WAS HELD THERE A FAST PRISONER
GOOD GOOD SAID THE KING LAUGHING
GOOD GRACIOUS
AGAIN THEY ALL ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD DO THERE SHE WHO WAS SO BLACK AND UGLY AND HAD NO CLOTHES THAT SHE COULD BE SEEN IN BY OTHER PEOPLE
GOODNESS GRACIOUS THEY CRIED WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CHILD AND THEY WERE SO ENCHANTED BY HER BEAUTY THAT THEY DID NOT WAKE HER BUT LET HER SLEEP ON IN THE LITTLE BED
ONE WOULD THINK THAT I AND MY CRUTCH WERE PUT IN ON PURPOSE TO MAKE THAT SLIM CHARMING YOUNG SHEPHERDESS IN THE NEXT PICTURE LOOK PRETTIER BY CONTRAST
SO THERE WERE SIGURD AND BRYNHILD BURNED TOGETHER AND THE CURSE OF THE DWARF ANDVARI WAS FULFILLED.(33 33 THE VOLSUNGA SAGA
WILL YOUR HIGHNESS PLEASE TO TASTE ANY OF THEM BY ALL MEANS SAID THE FAIRY ESPECIALLY AS THE PRINCESS WILL CERTAINLY BE GLAD OF A GOOD MEAL SO THE ADMIRAL SENT BACK TO HIS SHIP FOR EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDFUL AND THEY FEASTED MERRILY UNDER THE TREES
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT FOR CURING THE DEAF AND DUMB AND WHEN THE OLD BOATMAN SAW THAT HE WAS IN EARNEST HE TOLD ALL HE KNEW ABOUT THE CAVALIER AND THE LADY WHOM HE HAD LANDED UPON SQUIRREL ISLAND AND THE ADMIRAL KNEW IT MUST BE THE PRINCESS AND FANFARONADE
MIND PRINCE
ADMIRAL COCKED-HAT WAS IMMENSELY SURPRISED WHEN HE CAME UPON THE GOLDEN CHARIOT AND STILL MORE SO TO SEE TWO LOVELY LADIES WALKING UNDER THE TREES A LITTLE FARTHER AWAY
WHEN HE HAD GOT THE BITS OF BREAD HE FIRST PLUCKED OUT ONE FEATHER
THEY FOUND A VERY HIGH OAK TREE AND THERE THEY SAT TURN ABOUT KEEPING THEIR EYES ALWAYS FIXED ON THE CASTLE TOWER
NOW MICHAEL KNEW QUITE WELL WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ALL THE PRINCES BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE BEAUTIFUL EYES OF THE PRINCESS LINA INSPIRED HIM WITH A VIOLENT LONGING TO TRY HIS FATE
LET ME MAKE A TRIAL OF THESE THINGS AND THEN I WILL JUDGE BETWEEN YOU THEY WILLINGLY CONSENTED TO THIS BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT THE HAT THE CLOAK AND THE BOOTS HE SAID NEXT TIME WE MEET YOU SHALL HAVE MY DECISION AND HEREUPON HE WISHED HIMSELF AWAY
SO HE SENT BACK TO THE GUARDS TO SAY THAT THE PRINCE WAS TO BE TREATED AS SEVERELY AS BEFORE WHICH WAS JUST WHAT THEY HAD HOPED HE WOULD SAY
SHE LIFTED THE CHILD FROM ITS CRADLE LAID IT ON HER ARM AND NURSED IT FOR SOME TIME
BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN HE WAS TO BE KILLED AND SHOULD BE KILLED AND NOTHING ELSE WOULD SERVE
SHE TOLD ME OF A HOUSE A DISTANCE OFF WHERE I WOULD GET A WOMAN WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT
SHE WAS SO DAZZLED AND DELIGHTED BY WHAT SHE SAW THAT THERE SHE STAYED NEVER TAKING HER EYES AWAY FROM THE PEEP-HOLE FOR A SINGLE MINUTE UNTIL PRESENTLY THE AMBASSADOR'S PROCESSION APPEARED IN SIGHT
IN TIME SHE GREW QUITE FOND OF HIM HE WAS SO KIND AND GENTLE
THE PRINCE AFTER ONE GLANCE AT IT TURNED AWAY WITH A DISDAINFUL AIR WHICH GREATLY OFFENDED HIS FATHER
NOW THEY ARE CLOSE BEHIND US SAID THE MAN
THE THREE GIRLS ENTERED AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY SAW
BUT WHEN THE PRINCE WANTED TO REACH HER HER GOLD SHOE SHE SAID
NOW WE MUST SHOW WHAT WE CAN DO AND WENT AT IT ONCE MORE TILL THE STONES SPRANG UP SKY HIGH AND THUS THEY GOT UP
HUTETU SAID THE TROLL AS HE PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR
WHAT DOES THE KING I PRAY YOU TELL IS HE AWAKE OR SLEEPS HE WELL AND RECEIVING NO REPLY IT CONTINUED
SO YOU TWO HAVE FOUND ONE ANOTHER AGAIN I SEE BUT I HAVE STILL A SURPRISE LEFT FOR YOU
BUT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO DRINK OF THE PHILTRE AND SACRIFICE HIMSELF TO THE HAPPINESS OF HER HE LOVED
ALL THESE THINGS MUST WE HAVE LIKEWISE A BARREL OF TAR WITH TWELVE TONS OF TAR IN IT
THEY QUENCHED THE FLAMES AND PUT OUT THE FIRE AND UNBINDING THEIR DEAR SISTER FROM THE STAKE THEY KISSED AND HUGGED HER AGAIN AND AGAIN
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OF GAINING IT
WELL BENJAMIN WHAT'S THE NEWS THEY ASKED
JACK'S MOTHER WAS VERY GLAD TO GET THE MONEY BUT SHE DID NOT LIKE HIM TO RUN ANY RISK FOR HER
BUT FATHER IS SO QUICK-TEMPERED SO I HID HIM IN THE CUPBOARD BUT IF FATHER HAS NOT FOUND ANY ONE THEN THE MAN IS STILL HERE LET HIM COME IN SAID THE TROLL
HERE MAY YOU BEHOLD THEIR MEAT AND HERE THEIR DRINK SAID HE
THEN MINNIKIN HIMSELF TOOK HOLD OF THE CABLE AND LAID ONE OR TWO LINKS OF IT INTO THE SHIP AND AS HE THREW THE LINKS INTO IT THE SHIP GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AND AT LAST IT WAS SO LARGE THAT THE CABLE AND THE FIVE HUNDRED MEN AND PROVISIONS AND MINNIKIN HIMSELF HAD ROOM ENOUGH
AFTER SOME TIME THE SAME THING BEFELL THE SECOND DAUGHTER WHO WAS WOOED AND WON BY A PRINCE FROM THE WEST
THE BROTHERS WERE QUITE WILLING TO DO THIS
THE DWARF WAS REWARDED WITH A GOLD PIECE AND DECORATED WITH SO MANY RIBBONS THAT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO SEE HIM AT ALL
FALL TO WORK THIS VERY MINUTE BUT HEAVEN HELP THEE IF THOU DOST NOT BREW THE ALE STRONG OH IT SHALL TASTE WELL SAID MINNIKIN AND AT ONCE SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO BREW
IN THE GREY LIGHT OF DAWN THE MASTER OF THE HORSE LET OUT THE SEVEN FOALS AND OFF THEY WENT AGAIN OVER HILL AND DALE AND OFF WENT THE LAD AFTER THEM
SO ALL TURNED OUT JUST AS THE THREE LITTLE DWARFS HAD SAID
QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE MET FRIEND FOX ON HIS ROUNDS THAT WAY
NEXT MORNING THEY SET OUT EARLY TO RETURN TO HIS FATHER'S KINGDOM
OH I WILL TELL YOU THAT ANSWERED THE KITCHEN-MAID
THEN YOU MUST FLING DOWN THE GREAT STONE WHICH YOU TOOK AWAY FROM THE STABLE DOOR SAID THE EAGLE
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS I DO I WILL MARRY YOU INSTEAD OF YOUR MASTER
BUT WHEN NO ONE COULD TELL HIM WHERE THAT COUNTRY WAS HE CAUSED IT TO BE MADE KNOWN EVERYWHERE THAT HE WOULD MARRY ANY WOMAN WHO COULD PUT ON THE GOLD SHOE
WHO IS THAT WHO IS TOUCHING MY WOOD SAID THE TROLL
THE DAY HAD ALREADY DAWNED
WHEN THE HAMEL PEOPLE HEARD HOW THE AFFAIR HAD ENDED THEY RUBBED THEIR HANDS AND WITH NO MORE SCRUPLE THAN THEIR TOWN COUNSELLOR THEY LAUGHED OVER THE RATCATCHER WHO THEY SAID WAS CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP
WHEN HE GOT TO THE FOREST HE TOO MET THE LITTLE GREY OLD MAN WHO GREETED HIM AND SAID
GOOD MORNING MY DUCKLING SAYS THE LADY FRIEND WHITHER AWAY SO BOLD I AM GOING TO THE KING FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY FORSAKE IT IT SHALL STAY WITH YOU AS LONG AS YOU LIVE AND SHALL WANT FOR NOTHING THE KING PROMISED
TO-MORROW MORNING I HAVE TO GO BACK THERE FOR NOW THE QUEEN WHOSE KING IS STAYING AWAY IS TO MARRY SOME ONE ELSE IF THAT BE THE CASE I WILL GIVE YOU A PIECE OF ADVICE SAID THE MAN
WHEN HE TOLD US NOT TO GO INTO THAT ROOM HE MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND HAVE HAD A GOOD REASON FOR SAYING IT SURELY THE SKY WON'T FALL ABOUT OUR HEADS IF WE DO GO IN SAID THE SECOND PRINCESS
THE GIANT CALLED AGAIN TO THE RING WHICH BY THE POWER OF ENCHANTMENT ALWAYS MADE HIM ANSWER
THE NEXT DAY AT THE SAME HOUR HE WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN UNDER THE SAME TREE
WE DRINK YOUR HEALTH CURLICUE
WHERE ARE OUR POOR CHILDREN WAS THE CRY THAT WAS SOON HEARD IN ALL THE STREETS
HE WAS LOOKING SO CAREFULLY FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHONE MOST BRIGHTLY AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS UPON THE PORTRAIT OF A MOST SPLENDIDLY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
THEN THE WITCH SAID TO HER
HE WAS PUZZLED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT UNTIL IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO SEE IF THE WINDOWS WOULD HELP HIM AND LOOKING AT THE NEAREST HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF LIFTING THE PICTURE FROM THE WALL
NEXT MORNING IN THE GREY LIGHT OF DAWN THE MASTER OF THE HORSE LET OUT THE SEVEN FOALS AGAIN AND OFF THEY SET OVER HILL AND DALE THROUGH WOODS AND BOGS AND OFF WENT CINDERLAD AFTER THEM
SO SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT THE FAIRIES HAD PREDICTED ABOUT ROSETTE AND BEGGED HIM TO THINK HOW THE MISFORTUNES MIGHT BE PREVENTED
AND THEN SHE SENT HER BACK TO BE LOCKED INTO THE GARRET ONCE MORE
HE HOWEVER WAS VERY UNLIKELY TO DO THE TROLL MUCH INJURY FOR NO SOONER HAD THE PRINCESS SEATED HERSELF BY THE SEA-SHORE THAN RITTER RED CLIMBED UP INTO A GREAT TREE WHICH WAS STANDING THERE AND HID HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD AMONG THE BRANCHES
SHE RAN WEEPING TO HER STEPMOTHER AND TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT SHE SCOLDED HER HARSHLY AND WAS SO MERCILESS IN HER ANGER THAT SHE SAID
THE FAIRY DROVE HIM A LONG DISTANCE ROUND TILL THEY REACHED A VILLAGE WHICH LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL
THE PRINCE WILL BE CLEVER IF HE FINDS HIS BRIDE AND ARRANGING HER DRESS SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE GRASS TO AWAIT DESIRE
AMONG OTHER THINGS THE WITCH TOLD HER THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL MAGIC ARTS AND THAT SHE COULD FORETELL THE FUTURE AND KNEW THE HEALING POWERS OF HERBS AND PLANTS
IN THE MORNING WHEN HE STANDS AT THE GATES OF PARADISE HE IS HAPPY AND SMILES ON THE WHOLE WORLD BUT DURING THE DAY HE GETS CROSS BECAUSE HE SEES ALL THE EVIL DEEDS OF MEN AND THAT IS WHY HIS HEAT BECOMES SO SCORCHING
THE COOK TOLD HER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE A PLACE AND LEAVE TO STAY THERE AT ONCE AND WASH UP FOR THE GIRL WHO HAD DONE THAT BEFORE HAD JUST GONE AWAY
ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS THE STAR GAZER WHO BECAME A PRINCE
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A NOBLE KNIGHT WHO LIVED IN THIS CASTLE WHICH IS ON THE BORDERS OF FAIRYLAND
WHEN HIS MOTHER SAW HIM ENTER THE HOUSE SHE WEPT FOR JOY FOR SHE HAD FEARED THAT THE FAIRIES HAD CARRIED HIM AWAY OR THAT THE GIANT HAD FOUND HIM
THE NURSE HAD TAKEN ALL THE PAINS IMAGINABLE TO DECK OUT HER DAUGHTER
THERE WAS A LITTLE DOOR IN THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE CAVE AND HERE THE PRINCESS KNOCKED AND BEGGED FOR ADMISSION
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO THERE OH YES MY DEAR JUST LET ME GO SAID MINNIKIN
MINNIKIN ONCE MORE BEGGED THE COOK'S LEAVE TO GO DOWN TO THE SEA-SHORE FOR A SHORT TIME
AT THE DAWN OF THE THIRD DAY HE SAW A WONDROUS PALACE AND BY THE SIDE OF THE PALACE STOOD AN OAK AND ON THE OAK SAT A FALCON BRIGHT
THIS IS A DISMAL KIND OF WEDDING THEY SAID
BUT NOW MINNIKIN WAS NOT HAPPY FOR BOTH THE PRINCESSES WANTED TO HAVE HIM AND HE WANTED TO HAVE NONE OTHER THAN THE ONE WHOM HE HAD FIRST SAVED AND SHE WAS THE YOUNGER
DEAR DEAR SHE SAID TO HERSELF
MICHAEL HELD IN HIS HAND THE GOLDEN CUP AND HE REVEALED THE SECRET OF THE HOLES IN THE SHOES
WHEN THE MAN CAME WITH THE OX AND SAW THE SHOE HE WAS QUITE VEXED AT HAVING BEEN SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE THE FELLOW TO IT LYING WHERE IT WAS INSTEAD OF BRINGING IT ON WITH HIM
AS SOON AS ONE STEP WAS FINISHED SHE STOOD UPON IT AND MADE THE NEXT ONE AND THEN THE NEXT TILL SHE WAS CLOSE TO THE DOOR
HARDLY HAD THE SPINNER BEGUN TO WORK WHEN THE COUNT BEGAN TO FEEL HIS PAINS GROW LESS
YOU HAVE LEFT ME FOR MANY YEARS PAST TO FALL TO PIECES WITH THE DAMP
I SHALL EXPECT YOU THIS EVENING AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY
SEEING THE MAN IN BLACK ONE OF THE MEN CRIED THAT WAS THE BLACK THIEF AND PRESENTING HIS PIECE FIRED AT THE MAN AT WHICH I LET HIM FALL AND CREPT INTO A LITTLE DARK CORNER MYSELF THAT WAS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PLACE
HURRY PAST AS IF YOU NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD THEM
CLICK CLOCK CLACK OUR DIRTY SLUT'S COME BACK BUT THE PITCH REMAINED STICKING TO HER AND NEVER AS LONG AS SHE LIVED COULD IT BE GOT OFF.(26 26 GRIMM
IT IS A CHARMING PROFESSION
WHEN SHE HAD DONE IT AND DONE IT WELL ANOTHER HEAD ROSE UP OUT OF THE WATER AND THIS ONE WAS UGLIER STILL
SO SHE GAVE HIM AS MUCH AS HE WOULD HAVE AND THEN SHE ONCE MORE TRIED TO MAKE HIM GO AWAY
WHERE ARE THE HEADS THE RATCATCHER DID NOT EXPECT THIS TREACHEROUS STROKE
BUT THE THIRD TIME BEWARE
SIRE WE ARE ALL VERY SORRY TO SEE YOU SO SORRY
SO THE QUEEN IN GREAT TRIUMPH SENT FOR HER WAITING WOMEN WHO DRAGGED THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS AWAY AND SHUT HER UP IN A GARRET
IT FLIES JUST LIKE A BIRD SO THEY GOT ON ITS BACK AND RODE AWAY
BUT JUST AS SHE HAD BEEN BOUND TO THE STAKE AND THE FLAMES WERE LICKING HER GARMENTS WITH THEIR RED TONGUES THE VERY LAST MOMENT OF THE SEVEN YEARS HAD COME
MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GO INTO MY THROAT--GET INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU BY JOVE I THAT'S A GOOD IDEA SAYS COMRADE WASP'S-NEST
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT IT WAS IN THIS VERY COUNTRY THAT PRINCE PEERLESS HAD BEEN SET DOWN AND WHILE THE PRINCESS SUNBEAM WAS STILL SLEEPING PEACEFULLY HE CAME STROLLING ALONG IN SEARCH OF A SHADY PASTURE FOR HIS SHEEP
DID I FRIGHTEN YOU MY PRINCESS SAID HE
FORTUNATELY IT WAS NOW NEAR EVENING AND THE SEVEN DWARFS RETURNED HOME
THEN THE TROLL WILL COME AND BEAT THEE BUT THOU SHALT TAKE THE FLASK WHICH IS HANGING ON THE WALL AND ANOINT THYSELF WHERESOEVER HE HAS WOUNDED THEE AFTER WHICH THOU SHALT BE AS WELL AS BEFORE
SHE KEPT HER LITTLE HOOD UPON HER HEAD
AND SHE AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS ATE THEIR SUPPER WITH GREAT SATISFACTION AND THEN THE QUEEN GAVE WHAT WAS LEFT TO THE LITTLE MOUSE WHO DANCED BETTER THAN EVER AFTERWARDS
DARKNESS BEHIND ME BUT LIGHT ON MY WAY THAT THE PRINCE MAY NOT SEE WHERE I'M GOING TO-DAY THE PRINCE HAD NEVER SEEN THE EQUAL OF THAT GLOVE AND HE WENT FAR AND WIDE ASKING AFTER THE COUNTRY WHICH THE PROUD LADY WHO RODE AWAY WITHOUT HER GLOVE HAD SAID THAT SHE CAME FROM BUT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO COULD TELL HIM WHERE IT LAY
HIS REAL NAME WAS MICHAEL BUT HE WAS ALWAYS CALLED THE STAR GAZER BECAUSE WHEN HE DROVE HIS COWS OVER THE COMMONS TO SEEK FOR PASTURE HE WENT ALONG WITH HIS HEAD IN THE AIR GAPING AT NOTHING
NEXT SUNDAY SOME ONE HAD TO GO TO THE PRINCE WITH A COMB
TAKE ME WITH THEE DRAKESTAIL SAID TO HIMSELF
TAKE ME WITH THEE DRAKESTAIL SAID TO HIMSELF
TAKE ME WITH THEE DRAKESTAIL SAID TO HIMSELF
NOW ALL THIS TIME THE WICKED STEPMOTHER WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THESE POOR CHILDREN'S MISFORTUNES AND TRYING ADVENTURES WAS FEELING FULLY PERSUADED THAT SISTER HAD BEEN TORN TO PIECES BY WILD BEASTS AND BROTHER SHOT TO DEATH IN THE SHAPE OF A ROE
AFTER THIS BY FAIR WORDS AND GOOD PAYMENT HE BORROWED A RAGGED GOWN AND A JERKIN FROM AN AGED WOMAN AND THEN WITH A STAFF IN HIS HAND AND A POKE ON HIS BACK HE HOBBLED OFF AS EVENING CAME ON TOWARDS THE GOVERNOR'S STABLE
AS FOR ROSETTE'S PORTRAIT THAT WAS TAKEN UP TO THE PALACE AND THE KING DID NOTHING BUT GAZE AT IT ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT
THEN THEY ALL WENT THROUGH THE THREE WOODS AND WHEN THEY HAD PASSED THE DOOR OF THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE A GREAT NOISE WAS HEARD AS IF THE ENCHANTED CASTLE WAS CRUMBLING TO THE EARTH
THEY LOOKED INTO EVERY PLACE FROM THE WARDROBES TO THE STOVES AND THE QUEEN HERSELF RAN ABOUT FROM THE GARRET TO THE CELLAR BUT THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
SCARCELY WERE THEY THERE WHEN THE REINDEER APPEARED AND NURSED THE CHILD AS BEFORE
SO THE KING SENT A MESSENGER TO THE PRINCESS FOR THE RING
TAKE THIS PITCHER OF MILK AND DRINK IT UP AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T LEAVE A DROP FOR FANFARONADE THE PRINCESS QUITE ASTONISHED LOOKED ROUND AND SAW A BIG PITCHER FULL OF MILK BUT BEFORE SHE COULD RAISE IT TO HER LIPS THE THOUGHT OF HOW THIRSTY FANFARONADE MUST BE AFTER EATING AT LEAST FIFTEEN POUNDS OF HONEY MADE HER RUN BACK TO HIM AND SAY
MAKE HIM COME IN AND PUT HIM WITH THE TURKEYS AND CHICKENS THE PORTER DESCENDS
WHO HAS SLAIN THIS MIGHTY HOST THERE REPLIED UNTO HIM A LIVING MAN
OUR TRAVELLER WAS DELIGHTED WHEN HE HEARD THIS AND SAID
TIS I DRAKESTAIL
IT IS BETTER THAT ONE SHOULD DIE THAN TWO SAID HE
YOU ARE WEEPING BECAUSE THE QUEEN IS UNKIND TO YOU AND BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO STARVE YOU TO DEATH
HE ATE FOUR MEALS A DAY SLEPT TWELVE HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTY-FOUR AND THE ONLY THING HE EVER DID WAS TO SHOOT AT SMALL BIRDS WITH HIS BOW AND ARROW
HE OPENED IT SHUT AND LOCKED IT AFTER HIM AND FLEW BACK TO THE BEANSTALK WHICH HE DESCENDED AS FAST AS HIS FEET WOULD MOVE
THEN THE BIRD--HAVING TAKEN THE VESSEL ON HER BACK WITH THE PRINCE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF IT--BEGAN TO FLY
THEN SHE PUT ON THE WOODEN GOWN AND WALKED TO THE KING'S PALACE
LET HIM BE ALIVE OR LET HIM BE DEAD I'LL GRIND HIS BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD WIFE CRIED THE GIANT THERE IS A MAN IN THE CASTLE
THEY FOUND THE POOR IMPRISONED LITTLE HARE AND HAVING SET HIM FREE ALSO THEY ALL SET OUT TO LOOK FOR THEIR ENEMY
TIME HANGS HEAVILY ON MY HANDS WHEN I'M ALL ALONE IN THE WOOD
NEVER MIND HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
WELL YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO SHOW WHERE YOU ARE YOURSELF FOR I CAN'T FIND YOU SAID THE PRINCESS AND IN AN INSTANT THE YOUTH WAS STANDING BY HER SIDE ON THE FLOOR OF THE STABLE
SHE TOLD HIM THAT HER BROTHER NORKA WAS THEN AT HER YOUNGEST SISTER'S
SO YOU HAVE FOLLOWED US YES PRINCESS HOW DID YOU MANAGE IT
ALL WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE ELDEST
AT THE END OF THREE DAYS SHE CAME AGAIN BRINGING WITH HER A BOX
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE NOW
THEN SHE WENT AND WALKED NEAR IT AND SAID TO GRACIOSA AND ALL HER LADIES WHO WERE WITH HER
I MAY JUST AS WELL GO STRAIGHT HOME AGAIN SAID HE FOR IT IS NO USE TO GO TO THE KING'S PALACE WAIT TILL IT IS DUSK SAID THE OLD HAG AND THEN THE KING'S FOALS WILL PASS BY THIS PLACE AGAIN AND YOU CAN RUN HOME WITH THEM
THEY MAY THREATEN AND FORCE AS THEY WILL HE TURNS FROM HER SHRINKS FROM HER STILL AND IMMEDIATELY THE REINDEER LEFT THE HERD AND CAME TO THE CHILD AND TENDED IT AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
WHICH DO YOU LIKE CANARY ST JULIEN CHAMPAGNE HERMITAGE SACK RAISIN OR CIDER WELL SAID THE KING SINCE YOU ARE SO KIND AS TO ASK ME I PREFER CHAMPAGNE TO ANYTHING ELSE THEN DUCHESS GRUMBLY TOOK UP A LITTLE HAMMER AND TAPPED UPON THE CASK TWICE AND OUT CAME AT LEAST A THOUSAND CROWNS
YOU SHALL BE LIGHT AND AIRY AND AS GREEN AS THE GRASS YOU LIVE IN
EVERYDAY SHE GAVE THE PRINCESS A LOVELY NEW FROCK OF GOLD BROCADE OR SATIN OR VELVET AND WHEN SHE WAS HUNGRY SHE HAD BOWLS FULL OF SUGAR-PLUMS AND AT LEAST TWENTY POTS OF JAM
SNOWDROP LAY A LONG TIME IN THE COFFIN AND SHE ALWAYS LOOKED THE SAME JUST AS IF SHE WERE FAST ASLEEP AND SHE REMAINED AS WHITE AS SNOW AS RED AS BLOOD AND HER HAIR AS BLACK AS EBONY
I AM NOW GOING TO LEAVE YOU AND AS YOU ARE YOUNG AND IN YOUR PRIME OF COURSE AFTER MY DEATH YOU WILL MARRY AGAIN
WHAT A BIG TONGUE YOU'VE GOT GRANDMOTHER ALL THE BETTER FOR ANSWERING CHILD OH
WHEN THEY HAD SAILED THUS A LONG LONG WAY THE SHIP STOPPED SHORT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA
THE KING AND THE PRINCESS SALUTED HER AND HER HORSE WAS BROUGHT FORWARD FOR HER TO MOUNT
BUT NOW SHE AND SIGURD LOVED EACH OTHER AND PROMISED TO BE TRUE TO EACH OTHER AND HE GAVE HER A RING AND IT WAS THE LAST RING TAKEN FROM THE DWARF ANDVARI
DOWN FLEW THE EAGLE FROM THE OAK SMOTE UPON THE GROUND TURNED INTO A BRAVE YOUTH AND CRIED ALOUD
IT BLEW SO HARD AND RAINED SO HEAVILY THAT HE COULD SCARCELY KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF IT HE HAD GOT QUITE OUT OF THE TRACK AND COULD NEITHER FIND ROAD NOR PATH
HOWEVER HE HAD IT PLACED IN AS FAVOURABLE A LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND SENT FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT SHE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY AND BEGAN TO CRY
THE FALCON MARRIED HER AND BORE HER AWAY INTO HIS OWN REALM
AND SO IT CONTINUED EVER AFTER
SOME TIME OR OTHER I'LL DO YOU A GOOD TURN SO HE DIDN'T DISTURB IT BUT WENT ON
IF I COULD BUT GET UP INTO THE TURRET SHE THOUGHT TO SEE IF ANY ONE IS COMING BUT TO CLIMB UP THERE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
WELL NOW I HAVE NO TIME TO STAY WITH YOU ANY LONGER SAID THE WEST WIND FOR I MUST FIRST GO AND TEAR DOWN A BIT OF SPRUCE FIR BEFORE I GO TO THE BLEACHING-GROUND TO DRY THE CLOTHES
MAYBLOSSOM MORE DOWNCAST THAN EVER WENT SADLY AWAY AND SAT DOWN UNDER AN OAK TREE AND HER TEARS AND SIGHS WERE SO PITEOUS THAT THE OAK FANNED HER WITH HIS RUSTLING LEAVES AND SAID
COME ALONG AND LET US GO FORTH INTO THE WIDE WORLD TOGETHER SO OFF THEY STARTED THROUGH FIELDS AND MEADOWS OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES AND WALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG AND WHEN IT RAINED SISTER SAID
BUT THE KING'S SON STOOD FIRM BY WHAT HE HAD COMMANDED AND SAID
RUN AWAY AND LIE DOWN AMONG THE DEAD BODIES THAT HE HAS IN THE ROOM SHOWING ME THE PLACE AND STRIP OFF YOUR CLOTHES THAT HE MAY NOT KNOW YOU FROM THE REST IF HE HAS OCCASION TO GO THAT WAY I TOOK HER ADVICE AND LAID MYSELF DOWN AMONG THE REST AS IF DEAD TO SEE HOW HE WOULD BEHAVE
JACK WAS A GIDDY THOUGHTLESS BOY BUT VERY KIND-HEARTED AND AFFECTIONATE
HE WENT TO THE STABLE DOOR AND THERE HE STUMBLED AGAINST A HARD STONE WHICH HE PICKED UP AND BENEATH IT LAY THREE SPLINTERS OF WOOD WHICH HE ALSO PICKED UP
WHEN THE YOUTH HAD RUN THUS FOR A LONG TIME HE BEGAN TO BE TIRED AND WHEN HE HAD HELD ON A LITTLE LONGER HE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF WATCHING AT ALL AND AT THE SAME MOMENT HE CAME TO A CLEFT IN A ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH HER DISTAFF IN HER HAND
SO HE CAUSED THE BROTHER TO BE THROWN INTO A PIT FULL OF SNAKES
BUT SNOWDROP WAS GROWING PRETTIER AND PRETTIER EVERY DAY AND WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD SHE WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE COULD BE AND FAIRER EVEN THAN THE QUEEN HERSELF
SO THE KING CALLED TO HIM AGAIN BUT THE YOUTH WAS PRAYING SO FERVENTLY THAT HE DID NOT HEAR HIM THIS TIME EITHER
SHE SHOULD ONLY BE DRIVEN ABOUT A LITTLE AND IF HE TOOK HIS FINGER OUT MORE THAN ONCE SHE SHOULD HAVE TEN DOLLARS MORE
SHE MADE THEM INTO A SALAD WHICH TASTED SO GOOD THAT HER LONGING FOR THE FORBIDDEN FOOD WAS GREATER THAN EVER
QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK BUT TURKEYS AND CHICKENS ARE CREATURES WHO DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AS THEMSELVES
XII LINA'S SISTERS HAD SEEN HER TALKING TO THE LITTLE GARDEN BOY AND JEERED AT HER FOR IT
GOOD EVENING SAID THE OLD WOMAN
IF DEATH WAS SO SLOW IN COMING IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS NOT READY TO FOLLOW HIM HAVING NO SHROUD FOR HIS BURIAL
I DO BELIEVE I HEAR ONE HE JUMPED UP TOOK SISTER BY THE HAND AND THEY SET OFF TO HUNT FOR THE BROOK
THE QUEEN FELT QUITE CURIOUS ABOUT A LITTLE TURKEY-MAIDEN WHO DID NOT WISH TO BE A QUEEN SO THE LITTLE MOUSE CONVEYED HERSELF TO THE POULTRY-YARD TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE WAS LIKE
YOU WILL BE SAFE THERE AND SHE OPENED A HUGE WARDROBE WHICH STOOD IN THE GREAT HALL AND SHUT HIM INTO IT
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE BIRCH TREE AND LAID THE BRANCH UPON THE GRAVE
HOW DARED YOU THINK TO WIN MY LOVE BY SEPARATING ME FROM MY BELOVED FLORIMOND AND IN MY PRESENCE CUTTING OFF THAT DEAR HAND THAT EVEN YOU SHOULD HAVE FEARED AND HONOURED AND THEN THE TEARS ROLLED SLOWLY DOWN THE LOVELY LADY'S CHEEKS AND PRINCE CURLICUE BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THAT SHE WAS UNDER AN ENCHANTMENT AND THAT IT WAS THE HAND OF HER LOVER THAT HE HAD FOUND
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW IT SAID AFTER SOME TIME HAD GONE BY
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW IT SAID AFTER SOME TIME HAD GONE BY
THE QUEEN HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM CURLICUE BECAUSE IT WAS A NAME SHE RATHER LIKED AND IT SEEMED TO SUIT HIM
THEY SPRUNG UP EVEN IN THE WELL-TRODDEN FLOOR OF THE COTTAGE AND AS FAST AS THEY WERE UPROOTED THE DISTAFF GATHERED TO ITSELF A SUPPLY OF NETTLES CRUSHED PREPARED AND READY FOR SPINNING
BUT I WILL KNOW THE TRUTH HE SAID
RITTER RED HAS SAID THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO SET HER FREE BUT WHO KNOWS WHETHER HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT
SO THE TROLL STRUCK AT HIM WITH HIS IRON CLUB--WHICH WAS STILL BIGGER THAN THAT WHICH THE FIRST TROLL HAD HAD--SO THAT THE EARTH FLEW TEN YARDS UP IN THE AIR
NOW SIR SAYS HE TO THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN IF THAT BE NOT AS GREAT AN ADVENTURE AS EVER YOU HEARD TO BE WITHIN ONE BLOW OF A HATCHET OF MY END AND THAT BLOW EVEN DRAWN AND AFTER ALL TO ESCAPE I LEAVE IT TO YOURSELF WELL I CANNOT SAY BUT IT IS VERY EXTRAORDINARY SAYS THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN AND ON THAT ACCOUNT PARDON THIS YOUNG MAN HIS CRIME
BUT CONSIDERING AGAIN THAT IT WAS PERHAPS STILL IN THEIR POWER TO BECOME ALIVE AGAIN I GAVE OVER THE ATTEMPT AND CLIMBED WITH DIFFICULTY UP A TREE BRINGING MY SWORD IN MY HAND AND ALL THE GOLD ALONG WITH ME
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE ON HE SAID YOU WILL COME TO MY BROTHER WHO LIVES HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM HERE
RAPUNZEL ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE VERY UNHAPPY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO CHILDREN
IT IS TERRIBLE WEATHER OUTSIDE TO-NIGHT SAID THE YOUNG FELLOW
I HAD RATHER BE THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK ALL MY LIFE THAN INFLICT THE SIGHT OF MY UGLINESS ON ANYONE ELSE BUT THE KING WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HER AND SENT HER AWAY WITH THE AMBASSADORS
BUT THE KIND HORSE GRANI LAY DOWN AND DIED OF VERY GRIEF
AND BEING AT A CERTAIN TIME FAIRLY RUN OUT OF CASH AND MEETING WITH NO ENTERPRISE WORTHY OF NOTICE I WAS REDUCED TO GREAT STRAITS
BUT HE SAID NO HIS LUCK WAS GONE HIS SWORD WAS BROKEN AND HE MUST DIE
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN IF I DID SHE SAID TO HERSELF
AT FIRST THE QUEEN DID NOT KNOW HIM BECAUSE HE HAD GROWN SO THIN AND PALE FROM HAVING TRAVELLED SO LONG AND SO SORROWFULLY
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING INQUIRED THE MAN'S DAUGHTER
A HERALD WAS SENT WHO BLEW A TRUMPET AT EVERY STREET CORNER AND COMMANDED ALL THE BEST NURSES TO APPEAR BEFORE THE QUEEN THAT SHE MIGHT CHOOSE ONE FOR THE LITTLE PRINCESS
BUT HALVOR WENT ABOUT AND WAS SO STRANGE AND SO MOURNFUL AND QUIET THAT THE PRINCESSES ASKED WHAT IT WAS THAT HE LONGED FOR AND IF HE DID NOT LIKE TO BE WITH THEM
TELL ME WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ROSETTE FOR THAT WAS THE NAME THEY HAD GIVEN THE PRINCESS
OH WHAT CAN YOU WANT WITH THAT DIRTY RAGGED BOY IN HERE SAID RITTER RED BUT THE PRINCESS SAID THAT SHE INSISTED ON HAVING HIM AS CUP-BEARER AND WOULD HAVE NO ONE ELSE
NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW YES SAID CINDERLAD
WHEN HE CAME TO THAT RIVER HE WAVED THE HANDKERCHIEF THREE TIMES ON THE RIGHT HAND AND SUDDENLY SPRINGING GOODNESS KNOWS WHENCE THERE HUNG ACROSS THE RIVER HIGH IN THE AIR A SPLENDID BRIDGE
WHERE AM I NOW ASKED THE PRIEST
THE TALES HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED OR IN THE CASE OF THOSE FROM MADAME D'AULNOY'S LONG STORIES ADAPTED BY MRS HUNT FROM THE NORSE BY MISS MINNIE WRIGHT FROM MADAME D'AULNOY BY MRS LANG AND MISS BRUCE FROM OTHER FRENCH SOURCES BY MISS MAY SELLAR MISS FARQUHARSON AND MISS BLACKLEY FROM THE GERMAN WHILE THE STORY OF SIGURD IS CONDENSED BY THE EDITOR FROM MR WILLIAM MORRIS'S PROSE VERSION OF THE VOLSUNGA SAGA THE EDITOR HAS TO THANK HIS FRIEND M
BUT TO BE QUITE CERTAIN HE CALLED HIS DAUGHTERS TO HIM QUESTIONED THEM AND ORDERED THEM TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
THAT BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTER THAT MAN-EATER GRIM SHALL NURSE HIM SHALL TEND HIM NO MORE
THAT BLOODTHIRSTY MONSTER THAT MAN-EATER GRIM SHALL NURSE HIM SHALL TEND HIM NO MORE
BUT WHEN THE SUN HAD SET BEHIND THE FOREST UP CAME FLYING A BEE AND SAID
FOR THEN WILL I COME AND FETCH THEE AND BEAR THEE AWAY WITH ME IN A SACK AND THOU MUST LAY ALL THY GOLD AND SILVER AND WHATSOEVER THOU MAY ST POSSESS OF THIS WORLD'S WEALTH IN A HEAP IN THY BEST PARLOUR SO FATHER LAWRENCE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE ANGEL AND THANKED HIM AND THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY HE PREACHED A FAREWELL SERMON AND GAVE OUT THAT AN ANGEL HAD COME DOWN INTO THE LARGE MAPLE TREE IN HIS GARDEN AND HAD ANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS HE SHOULD BE TAKEN UP ALIVE INTO HEAVEN AND AS HE THUS PREACHED AND TOLD THEM THIS EVERYONE IN THE CHURCH OLD OR YOUNG WEPT
HERE'S A PRETTY STATE OF THINGS
HE GOT UP AND WENT TO SEE FOR HIMSELF AND WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS TRUE AND NO MISTAKE HE ACCEPTED HIS FATE PROPOSED TO THE WIDOW AND THEY WERE MARRIED AT ONCE
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR FORTUNE AND HE SAID
WILL YOU TELL HIM THAT THE MAN DID TELL HIM AND THE YOUTH THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO DO IT
WHEN THE OLD WITCH WANTED TO GET IN SHE STOOD UNDERNEATH AND CALLED OUT
YOU MUST GET INTO THE CASTLE AND IF POSSIBLE POSSESS YOURSELF OF A HEN THAT LAYS GOLDEN EGGS AND A HARP THAT TALKS
TEACH ME HOW TO BECOME INVISIBLE THEN THERE INSTANTLY APPEARED ON THE LAUREL A PRETTY WHITE FLOWER WHICH MICHAEL GATHERED AND STUCK INTO HIS BUTTON-HOLE
ON REACHING A TOWN THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS TO ORDER THREE PAIRS OF IRON SANDALS AND A STEEL STAFF AND HAVING MADE THESE PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY SHE SET OUT IN SEARCH OF HER HUSBAND
AND IN COURSE OF TIME THEY HAD A GREAT MANY CHILDREN
IT IS HE WHO DELIVERED ME FROM THE TROLL AND HE IS THE ONE WHOM I WILL HAVE THEN MINNIKIN RAN BACK TO THE KING'S PALACE AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE BUT FIRST HE WENT ON BOARD THE TROLL'S SHIP AND TOOK A GREAT QUANTITY OF GOLD AND SILVER AND OTHER PRECIOUS THINGS AND OUT OF THESE HE ONCE MORE GAVE TO THE KITCHEN-MAID A WHOLE ARMFUL OF GOLD AND SILVER HOOPS
BUT AFTERWARDS AS SHE SAT AT HER SPINNING-WHEEL SHE BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE LITTLE PRINCESS DID NOT GROW UP PRETTY ENOUGH TO PLEASE THE KING AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF
HE'S NOT ONE TO HAVE MONEY HE IS A TRAMP
I WARNED AND IMPLORED HER TO PAY NO HEED TO THAT VOICE HOWEVER LOUDLY IT MIGHT CALL WELL DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEARS PASSED AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO DISTURB THE PEACE OF THE HOUSEHOLD
HE LIFTED IT OUT CARRIED IT OFF AND TOOK IT WITH HIM TO AN INN WHERE HE MEANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT
IN THE EVENING WHEN THE KING CAME HOME AND HEARD THE NEWS OF HIS SON'S BIRTH HE WAS FULL OF DELIGHT AND INSISTED ON GOING AT ONCE TO HIS DEAR WIFE'S BEDSIDE TO SEE HOW SHE WAS GETTING ON
SO SHE FLUNG THE OTHER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND HELD HER WEDDING WITH HALVOR.(2 2 FROM P
THEN HE SAW SOME PEOPLE KNOCKING DOWN WALNUTS AND TRYING TO THROW THEM INTO A CART WITH A FORK
THE MAN GOT HIS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE HORSE AND WAS TREATED AS WELL AND WHEN THEY PARTED FROM EACH OTHER IT WAS JUST AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO TO REMEMBER TO TAKE OFF THE HALTER
AS SOON AS THEY CAME IN ROSETTE RAN TO EMBRACE HER BROTHERS WHILE THE TRAITORS THREW THEMSELVES DOWN BEFORE HER AND BEGGED FOR MERCY
BUT THE MOMENT HE HAD DRIVEN THE MARES AFIELD THEY COCKED UP THEIR TAILS AND AWAY THEY TORE ACROSS THE MEADOWS IN ALL DIRECTIONS
SO THE RING CAME OFF AND WAS LOST AMONG THE ASHES
THAT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE SAID THE MASTER THIEF
YOU HAVE FREED THESE TWO PRINCES BY YOUR STORIES
I SAY THAT SHE SHALL BE THE UNLUCKIEST OF THE UNLUCKY UNTIL SHE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD THEN THE QUEEN AND ALL THE FAIRIES BEGAN TO BEG AND BESEECH HER TO THINK BETTER OF IT AND NOT BE SO UNKIND TO THE POOR LITTLE PRINCESS WHO HAD NEVER DONE HER ANY HARM
WITH THEM PRINCE IVAN STOPPED THREE DAYS
YES HERE MAY YOU BEHOLD THEIR MEAT AND HERE THEIR DRINK THE KING ONCE MORE BECAME WROTH AND COMMANDED THAT THREE RED STRIPES SHOULD BE CUT ON THE LAD'S BACK THAT SALT SHOULD BE STREWN UPON THEM AND THAT HE SHOULD THEN BE INSTANTLY CHASED BACK TO HIS OWN HOME
BUT THE MOST UNHAPPY OF ALL WAS THE TOWN COUNSELLOR FOR HE LOST THREE LITTLE BOYS AND TWO PRETTY LITTLE GIRLS AND TO CROWN ALL THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL OVERWHELMED HIM WITH REPROACHES FORGETTING THAT THE EVENING BEFORE THEY HAD ALL AGREED WITH HIM
THE LADY IN THE GOLDEN DRESS APPEARED TO HIM ONCE MORE HOLDING IN ONE HAND TWO YOUNG LAUREL TREES A CHERRY LAUREL AND A ROSE LAUREL AND IN THE OTHER HAND A LITTLE GOLDEN RAKE A LITTLE GOLDEN BUCKET AND A SILKEN TOWEL
HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT ANY HORSE COULD BECOME SO BIG AND OVERGROWN FOR THE DAPPLED HORSE HAD TO LIE DOWN ON ALL FOURS BEFORE THE YOUTH COULD GET ON HIS BACK AND IT WAS VERY HARD TO DO THAT EVEN WHEN IT WAS LYING DOWN AND IT WAS SO PLUMP THAT ITS COAT SHONE AND GLISTENED JUST AS IF IT HAD BEEN A LOOKING-GLASS
THERE WAS NOTHING BUT SNOW FAR AND NEAR AND NOT A GREEN BLADE OF GRASS TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE
YES YES THEN SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
WHEN SHE CAME OUT OF THE FAINTING FIT INTO WHICH SHE HAD FALLEN IN HER TERROR HER SISTERS TRIED TO COMFORT HER SAYING
SO THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY TOGETHER BOTH VOWING VENGEANCE ON THE MUSICIAN
BUT THE HORSE HAD ALREADY SHAKEN OFF THE HALTER AND FLUNG HIMSELF INTO A GOOSE-POND WHERE HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A LITTLE FISH
WHEN HE HAD ROAMED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME HE CAME TO THE KING'S PALACE WHERE HE OBTAINED A PLACE UNDER THE COACHMAN
WHAT HAD BECOME OF ALL THESE UNFORTUNATE CHILDREN
THE MASTER THIEF LIVED WELL AND HAPPILY FROM THAT TIME FORTH AND WHETHER HE EVER STOLE ANY MORE OR NOT I CANNOT TELL YOU BUT IF HE DID IT WAS BUT FOR PASTIME
NO DOUBT RENELDE'S SPINNING-WHEEL KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
SHE WAS QUAINTLY DRESSED IN A RUFF AND FARTHINGALE AND A VELVET HOOD COVERED HER SNOW-WHITE HAIR
WHEN THE QUEEN SAW HER RETURNING SHE FELL UPON THE FAIRY WHOM SHE HAD KEPT WITH HER AND PULLED HER HAIR AND SCRATCHED HER FACE AND WOULD REALLY HAVE KILLED HER IF A FAIRY COULD BE KILLED
WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE TOLD THEM HOW HALVOR HAD COME HOME AGAIN AND NOW THEY SHOULD JUST SEE HOW MAGNIFICENT HE WAS
ALL THE BOYS IN THE COUNTRY SIDE WERE THERE ARMED WITH WOODEN SWORDS AND DECORATED WITH EPAULETS MADE OF GILT PAPER
THEN HE RECOGNISED HIM AND SAID BUT WHAT TRADE HAVE YOU TAKEN TO THAT HAS MADE YOU SUCH A GREAT MAN IN SO SHORT A TIME OH THAT I WILL TELL YOU ANSWERED THE YOUTH
NOW IN THE NEXT KINGDOM EVERYTHING WAS AS DIFFERENT AS IT COULD POSSIBLY BE
ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS
ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS
WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME TO GET YOUR EYE BACK SAID MINNIKIN
HAIL PRINCE SAYS SHE
AS SOON AS THEY WERE SURE THIS WAS THE CASE THE OLD WITCH TIED A CAP ON HER DAUGHTER'S HEAD AND LAID HER IN THE QUEEN'S BED
LAY SAID THE GIANT AGAIN
IF YOU PLEASE MA'AM SAID HE IS THIS YOUR HOUSE NO SAID THE OLD LADY
GO ALONG MASTER
SHE WILL SOON FIND OUT YOU ARE HERE AND WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T LET ANYONE INTO THE HOUSE NOW THE QUEEN AFTER SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD EATEN SNOWDROP'S LUNGS AND LIVER NEVER DREAMED BUT THAT SHE WAS ONCE MORE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD
HI
HER NAME WAS GUDRUN AND HER MOTHER WAS A WITCH
HE WAS CARRIED BACK TO THE CASTLE UNCONSCIOUS
THE YOUTH WENT TO THE KING AND ASKED FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT DAPPLEGRIM HAD NAMED AND ONCE MORE AS THE KING THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL TO REFUSE THEM TO HIM HE OBTAINED THEM ALL
STRAWBERRIES DON'T GROW IN WINTER
IT HAD NO WINDOWS SO IT WAS LIGHTED WITH WAX CANDLES AND THE ONLY WAY INTO IT WAS BY AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE WHICH HAD IRON DOORS ONLY TWENTY FEET APART AND GUARDS WERE POSTED EVERYWHERE
IN THE MEANTIME THE YOUTH HAD TAKEN THE OX AND GONE OFF WITH IT
BUT I MAY AS WELL SOW THEM SO HE TOOK A PIECE OF STICK AND MADE SOME HOLES IN THE GROUND AND PUT IN THE BEANS
YOU MAY HANG THERE FOR ME WHETHER YOU ARE A HOBGOBLIN OR NOT AND ON HE WENT WITH HIS OX
THE CARRIAGE STOOD STILL AND THE KING ASKED HER
MY DEAR FRIEND SAID THE QUEEN
SO HE DRESSED HIMSELF UP LIKE A BIRD AND THREW A GREAT WHITE SHEET OVER HIMSELF
TO COMPLETE HER GENEROUS WORK THE FAIRY PRESENTED THEM WITH THE WONDERFUL CABINET AND ALL THE TREASURES IT CONTAINED WHICH WERE WORTH AT LEAST TEN KINGDOMS
SIGURD CHOSE HIM
THE QUEEN THANKED AND REWARDED HIM AND HASTENED BACK TO THE CASTLE TO TELL THE KING
THE WAY TO HEAVEN IS NOT AN EASY ONE SAID THE MASTER THIEF AND DRAGGED HIM ALONG TILL HE ALL BUT KILLED HIM
THE DANES WHO USED TO FIGHT WITH THE ENGLISH IN KING ALFRED'S TIME KNEW THIS STORY
THEY USED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AS MUCH AS THEY NOW HATE ONE ANOTHER
I WILL TRY TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY PLACE WHERE I CAN LEARN HOW TO FIND WHITELAND HE THOUGHT AND JOURNEYED FORTH OUT INTO THE WORLD
I PRAY THAT HEAVEN MAY SEND YOU TO SLEEP SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND INSTANTLY THE CHIEF OF THE SCULLIONS FELL FAST ASLEEP AND THE GOOSE WAS BURNT TO A CINDER
BUT AFTER A TIME JACK MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO AGAIN TO THE GIANT'S CASTLE
LET US SWEAR VENGEANCE AND VOW THAT WHEREVER AND WHENEVER WE SHALL MEET ONE OF HER SEX SHE SHALL DIE AT OUR HANDS THEN THEY WENT THEIR WAY DEEPER INTO THE WOOD AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WHERE IT WAS THICKEST AND DARKEST THEY CAME UPON A LITTLE ENCHANTED HOUSE WHICH STOOD EMPTY
THE BLACK THIEF AND KNIGHT OF THE GLEN
HE WOULD HEAR HIM QUITE SOON ENOUGH WHEN HE BEGAN TO SQUALL FOR SOME FOOD
UPON THIS HER NURSE CAME FORWARD AND SAID
THE QUEEN SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN SITTING TOO NEAR THE FIRE AND HAD BURNT ALL THE FLAX THAT WAS UPON HER DISTAFF
THOSE WHO KNEW HIM REPLIED THAT A KNOWING DRAKESTAIL WAS A MORE WORTHY KING THAN A SPENDTHRIFT LIKE HIM WHO WAS LYING ON THE PAVEMENT
LITTLE ONE SAID THE QUEEN IT COST ME DEAR TO SAVE YOUR LIFE
BUT IT IS FEARFULLY COLD SAID ONE AND BEGAN TO BEAT HIS ARMS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS HIS BREAST
IF I DID BUT KNOW WHERE TO FIND A LITTLE STREAM I'D GO AND HAVE A DRINK
WELL BROTHERS FAREWELL
MY DEAR MOTHER YOUR DUTY REQUIRES YOU TO WIN IT BACK FOR YOUR MOTHER
LET US SEE IF WE CAN LIFT IT SO THEY ALL BEGAN TO PUSH AND PULL AT IT AND GRACIOSA AMONG THE OTHERS WHICH WAS JUST WHAT THE QUEEN WANTED
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE DAUGHTER OF MINE BUT IF YOU CAN SET FREE THE OTHER WHO HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE TROLL YOU SHALL WILLINGLY HAVE HER TOO AND THE OTHER HALF OF THE KINGDOM AS WELL I MAY AS WELL MAKE THE ATTEMPT SAID MINNIKIN BUT I MUST HAVE AN IRON ROPE WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED ELLS LONG AND THEN I MUST HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MEN WITH ME AND PROVISIONS FOR FIVE WEEKS FOR I HAVE A LONG VOYAGE BEFORE ME SO THE KING SAID HE SHOULD HAVE THESE THINGS BUT THE KING WAS AFRAID THAT HE HAD NO SHIP LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY THEM ALL
I HAD NOT GONE IN FAR UNTIL I HEARD A FOOT COMING TOWARDS ME WITH A QUICK PACE AND ALTHOUGH NATURALLY BOLD AND DARING YET THINKING OF THE DECEASED BISHOP AND THE CRIME I WAS ENGAGED IN I LOST COURAGE AND RAN TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE OF THE VAULT
HE FLUNG OPEN THE WINDOW AND SLIDING DOWN THE VINE WHICH CLIMBED UP THE WALL FOUND HIMSELF IN THE GARDEN JUST AS THE SUN WAS BEGINNING TO RISE AND IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO SET TO HIS WORK
BUT HE HAS FORGOTTEN ME AND MY PROMISE I MUST KEEP SO GUNNAR AND BRYNHILD WERE MARRIED THOUGH IT WAS NOT GUNNAR BUT SIGURD IN GUNNAR'S SHAPE THAT HAD RIDDEN THE FIRE
SINCE YOU WILL NOT MARRY ANYONE BUT THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WE ARE GOING OUT TOGETHER INTO THE WIDE WORLD TO SEARCH FOR HIM
ANOTHER SWORD HE MADE AND SIGURD BROKE THAT TOO
NOW THE KING HAD A DEER PARK IN WHICH WERE QUANTITIES OF WILD ANIMALS OF DIFFERENT KINDS
THEN HE LAUGHED AT THEM FOR BEING SUCH COWARDS AND SAID
COME SOME OF YOU AND HIDE YOURSELVES AND IF IT COMES AGAIN CATCH IT AND WRING ITS NECK HE SPITTED A THIRD GOOSE LIT A HUGE FIRE AND SEATED HIMSELF BY IT
BUT THE ASTONISHING PART OF IT WAS THAT THE YOUNGEST SISTER DID NOT SEEM AT ALL TO RELISH THIS METHOD OF STOPPING THE MOUTH OF THE GARDENER'S BOY WHO AFTER ALL HAD SAID NOTHING TO THEIR FATHER
SHE ANSWERED THAT A FAIRY WHOSE NAME SHE DID NOT KNOW HAD COME AND CARRIED HER OFF BY FORCE
I HAVE SO OFTEN HEARD OF YOU AND WISHED TO SEE YOU
GO TO THE CASTLE OF BELOEIL AND YOU SHALL MARRY A PRINCESS IN THE EVENING MICHAEL TOLD HIS FRIENDS THAT HE HAD DREAMED THE SAME DREAM AGAIN BUT THEY ONLY LAUGHED AT HIM MORE THAN BEFORE
OF ALL THE FAIRIES THE QUEEN KNEW ONLY FIVE WERE ABLE TO COME ON THE DAY APPOINTED BUT THEY BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO BESTOW GIFTS UPON THE PRINCESS
YOUR DAUGHTER OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN PRETTIER BUT SHE ANSWERED
I'VE NOT THE SMALLEST WISH FOR HIS SOCIETY BUT THE WOLF APPROACHED HIM AND SAID
XVI THE PRINCESS LINA DID NOT BECOME A GARDENER'S WIFE
HE LET HER FALL TIS TRUE AND MY CHILD'S FOOT WAS BROKEN THE MAN'S DAUGHTER HELD HER PEACE ALL THE TIME AND BUSIED HERSELF ABOUT THE HEARTH
WHEN THE FOX SAW HIM RUNNING BY HE CALLED OUT AS LOUD AS HE COULD
NOW THIS WAS THE MOTHER OF THOSE SMALL BIRDS WHICH THE PRINCE HAD COVERED UP
AND THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH HALVOR AND HE WITH THEM AND HE WAS TO CHOOSE THE ONE HE LIKED BEST
WHEN HE HAD RUN THUS FOR A LONG TIME HE TOO CAME TO THE CLEFT IN THE ROCK
BUT HE REMEMBERED THAT FEAR DISGRACES A MAN
ALL THEIR CLOTHES WERE JUST LIKE WHAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE OTHER WORLD
BUT AS YOU WILL NOT GO TRY IF YOU CAN WIELD THAT SWORD WHICH THE TROLL USES IN BATTLE HE COULD NOT BRANDISH THE SWORD
ALL IS LOST
NO ONE HAS CALLED ME MOTHER THIS HUNDRED YEARS CAN I LODGE HERE TO-NIGHT SAID THE MAN
NO ONE HAS CALLED ME MOTHER THIS HUNDRED YEARS CAN I LODGE HERE TO-NIGHT SAID THE MAN
AND HE HAMMERED AND WROUGHT THEM INTO A NEW SWORD SO SHARP THAT FIRE SEEMED TO BURN ALONG ITS EDGES
HE SOON GOT LEAVE TO DO THAT AND SET OUT ON HIS WAY INTO THE WORLD
BUT HE TOOK HIS ARMS AND WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE PARK AND SAT DOWN ON THE GRASS IN SUCH A POSITION THAT THE MOMENT HE WENT ASLEEP HIS WEAPONS WOULD PRICK HIM AND HE WOULD AWAKE
THE GIRL WAS MUCH STARTLED WHEN INSTEAD OF THE LITTLE ROE SHE EXPECTED SHE SAW A MAN WITH A GOLD CROWN ON HIS HEAD WALK IN
BUT THE WHOLE COURT WAS AMAZED AT HER DEMAND KNOWING VERY WELL THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM EVER TO GET THE STEED AS ALL THAT EVER SOUGHT HIM PERISHED IN THE ATTEMPT
KNOCK KNOCK
WELL I HAVE NOT EXACTLY BEEN THINKING OF SELLING HIM SAID THE MAN BUT IF WE COULD AGREE PERHAPS HALVOR INQUIRED HOW MUCH HE WANTED TO HAVE FOR THE HORSE
BUT THE OTHER WAS DRAWN BY BATS AND RAVENS AND CONTAINED A FRIGHTFUL LITTLE DWARF WHO WAS DRESSED IN A SNAKE'S SKIN AND WORE A GREAT TOAD UPON HER HEAD FOR A HOOD
NOW MOTHER STAND OUT OF THE WAY SAID HE
THE ELDEST BROTHER WAS CALLED THE GREAT PRINCE AND THE SECOND THE LITTLE PRINCE THEY LOVED THEIR SISTER DEARLY FOR SHE WAS THE SWEETEST PRETTIEST PRINCESS WHO WAS EVER SEEN AND THE LEAST LITTLE SMILE FROM HER WAS WORTH MORE THAN A HUNDRED PIECES OF GOLD
OH WHAT COULD YOU DO DOWN AT THE STRAND SAID THE KITCHEN-MAID
THERE HE WAITED AND PRESENTLY THE EARTH BEGAN TO SHAKE WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE DRAGON AS HE CRAWLED TO THE WATER
HE LOOKED HIGH AND HE LOOKED LOW HE LOOKED BEFORE AND HE LOOKED BEHIND BUT THERE WAS NOT A HAIR'S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
HOWEVER THE COUNT GREW WORSE AND WORSE TILL HE WAS GIVEN UP BY THE DOCTORS
SO HE GAVE THE ORDER FOR THE FLEET TO SURROUND THE ISLAND
HER ELDER SISTERS HOWEVER LEFT HER NO PEACE AND WILL SHE NILL SHE THEY DRAGGED HER UP TO THE TABLE AND IN FEAR AND TREMBLING SHE TURNED OVER THE PAGE AND READ
COLD WATER DOESN'T SUIT ME AT ALL
HOW UGLY SHE IS
THE YOUTH SEATED HIMSELF ON HIM AND ONCE MORE THEY WENT THEIR WAY AND FOR EACH HOP THAT DAPPLEGRIM MADE DOWN WENT THE HILL FIFTEEN ELLS INTO THE EARTH AND SO THEY WENT ON UNTIL THERE WAS NO HILL LEFT FOR THE KING TO SEE
IT IS I
HUTETU SAID THE OLD WOMAN GNASHING HER TEETH TOGETHER TILL THEY CHATTERED INSIDE HER MOUTH
UPON THIS THE PEOPLE CRIED WITH ONE ACCORD WE WILL WE WILL
WELL RUN ALONG POOR CHILD FOR HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT AS THEY WERE GOING DOWN THE HILL THEY STUMBLED OVER A BUSH AND JOLTED THE COFFIN SO VIOLENTLY THAT THE POISONOUS BIT OF APPLE SNOWDROP HAD SWALLOWED FELL OUT OF HER THROAT
THE WOOD BECAME THICKER AND THICKER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER AND AT LAST SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO WAY WHATSOEVER BY WHICH THEY COULD GET FORWARD
WILL YOU COME AWAY WITH ME MOST GLADLY SHE REPLIED FOR SHE KNEW HOW WILLINGLY SHE WOULD LEAVE HER STEPMOTHER AND SISTER AND HOW GLAD THEY WOULD BE TO BE RID OF HER
FIRST HAVE I WON ONE PRINCESS AND HALF THE KINGDOM AND THEN THE OTHER PRINCESS AND THE OTHER HALF OF THE KINGDOM
IN THIS EXTREMITY HE REMEMBERED WHAT HE HAD TOLD THE LITTLE SPINNER LONG AGO
AFTER WHICH HE TOOK THE TONGUE AND THE LUNGS OF THE TROLL AND PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF AND THEN HE CONDUCTED THE PRINCESS BACK TO THE PALACE
BUT NOW YOU MUST TAKE OUT YOUR LITTLE KNIFE AND CUT OFF MY HEAD WITH IT AND THEN YOU MUST FLAY ME AND ROLL UP MY HIDE AND PUT IT THERE UNDER THE ROCK AND BENEATH THE HIDE YOU MUST LAY THE COPPER LEAF AND THE SILVER LEAF AND THE GOLDEN APPLE
NO SOONER HAD THE SEVEN PRINCES COME OUT INTO THE CHURCHYARD THAN THEY BECAME FOALS AGAIN AND CINDERLAD GOT UPON THE BACK OF THE YOUNGEST AND THEY RETURNED BY THE WAY THEY HAD COME ONLY THEY WENT MUCH MUCH FASTER
IN THESE WANDERINGS SHE MET WITH EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES THAN BEFORE FOR SHE CAME UPON ONE MOUNTAIN OF FLINTS AFTER ANOTHER OUT OF WHICH TONGUES OF FIRE WOULD FLAME UP
ONE DAY THE ELDEST LAD SAID THAT HE WOULD GO OUT TO EARN HIS LIVING
THOUGH HE HAD ONLY HIS DAGGER HE DEFENDED HIMSELF SO WELL THAT HE ESCAPED WITHOUT ANY HARM AND PRESENTLY THE OLD FAIRY STOPPED THE FRAY AND ASKED THE PRINCE IF HE WAS STILL OF THE SAME MIND
I KNOW NOW SAID THE WOLF
NO DOUBT I SHALL SOON FIND A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO PLUCK OUT ONE OF ITS FEATHERS AND THE FIRST TIME DULLHEAD HAPPENED TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE GOOSE BY ITS WING
LET'S LOWER THE ROPE PULL OUR BROTHER PART OF THE WAY UP AND THEN CUT THE ROPE
LET US BE QUICK AND RUN AWAY FOR WE SHALL NEVER HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN THIS THEN SHE TOOK THE KING'S DAGGER WHICH WAS IN A DIAMOND SHEATH AND THE QUEEN'S NECK-HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HER HAND TO FANFARONADE WHO CARRIED A LANTERN AND THEY RAN OUT TOGETHER INTO THE MUDDY STREET AND DOWN TO THE SEA-SHORE
SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND TRIED IN VAIN TO CLIMB UP TO THE DOOR
I AM GOING TO LOOK FOR MY WIFE THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA HARD WILL IT BE FOR YOU TO FIND HER REPLIED THE EAGLE
THE THREE DWARFS THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN WHO LOST HIS WIFE AND A WOMAN WHO LOST HER HUSBAND
HE BEGGED HER TO CONSIDER AGAIN HOW UNHAPPY THE WICKED QUEEN WOULD MAKE HER AND HOW IF SHE WOULD BUT MARRY HIM ALL THE FAIRY PALACE WOULD BE HERS AND HIS ONE THOUGHT WOULD BE TO PLEASE HER
SO THE TAILOR WENT
HALVOR THEN INQUIRED IF HE COULD STAY THERE AND HAVE LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
SHE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM BUT SHE RULED OVER ALL THE FISHES SHE SAID AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING
THEY HAD BEEN LIVING FOR SOME TIME IN THE FOREST IN THIS WAY WHEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY HAD A GREAT HUNT THROUGH THE WOODS
GOOD EVENING I GOOD EVENING SAID THE OLD HAG
HOW DOES YOUR HIGHNESS FIND YOURSELF I HAVE PULLED MY TAIL OFF REPLIED THE YOUNGER MOUSE BUT AS I SHOULD STILL BE ON THE SORCERER'S TABLE UNLESS I HAD I DO NOT REGRET IT
SEEING THAT DEATH WAS DRAWING NEAR HER SHE CALLED THE KING TO HER AND SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
WE NEVER WENT SO SLOWLY BEFORE SAID THE PRINCESS
WHEN THOU HAST CUT OFF OUR HEADS THOU MUST TAKE THE GREATEST CARE TO LAY EACH HEAD AT THE TAIL OF THE BODY TO WHICH IT BELONGED BEFORE AND THEN THE SPELL WHICH THE TROLL HAS CAST UPON US WILL LOSE ALL ITS POWER CINDERLAD PROMISED TO DO THIS AND THEN THEY WENT ON FARTHER
HE NEVER VENTURES TO OPEN THAT
WHO DRINKS OF ME WILL BE A TIGER SO SHE CRIED OUT OH
I'M HERE THE DOOR OPENED AND HE RAN IN AND RESTED ALL NIGHT ON HIS SOFT MOSSY BED
ALAS I DEAR LITTLE MOTHER I HAVE LOST MY GOLD SLIPPERS LET THEM BE WAS HER MOTHER'S REPLY
THERE THE OLD HAG WAS ONCE MORE SITTING SPINNING FROM HER DISTAFF AND SHE CRIED TO CINDERLAD
IF THOU DIDST BUT KNOW AS MUCH AS I KNOW THOU WOULDST FLY IN TO ME THROUGH THE WINDOW SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE DOVE
WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
I SHOULD SO LIKE TO GO DOWN THERE AND AMUSE MYSELF A LITTLE WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN SO THIS TIME ALSO SHE SAID THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LEAVE TO GO BUT HE MUST FIRST PROMISE THAT HE WOULD BE BACK BY THE TIME THE JOINT WAS TURNED AND THAT HE WOULD BRING A GREAT ARMFUL OF WOOD WITH HIM
AND AS BEFORE WHEN SHE SEWED THE COUNT FELT HIS PAINS GROW LESS AND THE LIFE SINKING WITHIN HIM AND WHEN THE NEEDLE MADE THE LAST STITCH HE GAVE HIS LAST SIGH
IN THE MEANTIME THEIR LITTLE SISTER AT HOME WAS GROWING UP QUICKLY
BUT IF A YOUNG MAN THOU SHALT BE MY HUSBAND DEAR
HERE IS THE REWARD OF YOUR DISCRETION AND SHE FLUNG THE BOY A PURSE OF GOLD
IT WILL NOW COST US A BATTLE FOR LIFE OR DEATH FOR THIS TROLL HAS SIX HEADS AND IS TWICE AS STRONG AS THE OTHER BUT DO BE CAREFUL TO KEEP THE LEAF JUST AS HE SAID THIS CAME THE TROLL
WHEN SHE HAD DONE THAT SHE WENT AWAY TO THE PIG-STY BUT ALL THE WAY AS SHE WENT SHE WEPT AND WAS VERY SORROWFUL
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE RED FAIRY BOOK BY VARIOUS
AH SAID HE TO SISTER DO LET ME GO OFF TO THE HUNT
DESIRE FLUNG HIM THE OAT CAKE WHICH THE GREAT DOG INSTANTLY SNAPPED UP AND THE YOUNG PRINCE PASSED QUIETLY ON
OH NO YOU MUST NOT DO THAT SAID HIS WIFE
VII SO ANOTHER YEAR WENT BY
WHAT I WHEN ALL WENT SO ILL WITH US DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SUCCEED
AH WELL SAID THE FAIRY TO-MORROW I MAY HAVE SOME PLEASANT NEWS FOR YOU SO SHE HURRIED BACK TO HER CASTLE WHERE THE QUEEN SAT BUSY WITH HER EMBROIDERY AND CRIED
BUT IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO GET HIM FOR HE IS UNDERGROUND
I'LL LACE YOU UP PROPERLY FOR ONCE SNOWDROP SUSPECTING NO EVIL STOOD BEFORE HER AND LET HER LACE HER BODICE UP BUT THE OLD WOMAN LACED HER SO QUICKLY AND SO TIGHTLY THAT IT TOOK SNOWDROP'S BREATH AWAY AND SHE FELL DOWN DEAD
WASP'S-NEST WASP'S-NEST MAKE A SALLY OR DRAKESTAIL NEVERMORE MAY RALLY HEREUPON THE SCENE CHANGES
DRAKESTAIL WAS IN DESPAIR OF GETTING HIMSELF OUT OF SUCH A DEEP HOLE WHEN HE REMEMBERED HIS LADY FRIEND THE LADDER
YOU YOURSELF ARRANGED THAT HE WAS TO COME HERE YES MOTHER I WILL SHOOT HIM SAID HE AND LAY THERE AIMING AND THEN AIMING AGAIN FOR NO SOONER WAS THE HEAD UP AND HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT THAN IT WAS GONE AGAIN
WE HAVE BEEN GLOOMY AND MISERABLE TOO LONG ALREADY AND THEY ALL TOOK HANDS AND DANCED ROUND THE QUEEN AND DELICIA AND THE GOOD FAIRY SINGING
THE KING THEN AWOKE AND SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND HOW HER STEP-MOTHER AND STEP-SISTER HAD BETRAYED HER
HE PULLED IT OUT AND LO
WELL MADAM
ACCORDINGLY HE PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE PRINCESSES ROOM WITH THE TWELVE BOUQUETS IN A BASKET
GET UP OLD MAN
DO NOT CRY DEAREST MOTHER
RENELDE MY LORD YOU MUST GET TIRED OF STAYING IN SUCH A LONELY PLACE I AM ACCUSTOMED TO IT MY LORD AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF IT THAT MAY BE SO
SHE WAS AS CAREFUL AS SHE COULD BE AND BENT ASIDE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE BRANCHES AND THRUST THEM AWAY FROM BEFORE HER WITH HER HANDS
INDEED I AM DEAR LITTLE MOTHER ANSWERED THE DAUGHTER THEY THREW ME ACROSS THE RIVER TO MAKE A BRIDGE OF ME IN A MOMENT THE WITCH HAD THE BRIDGE SHIVERED TO ATOMS AND THEN SHE HASTENED AWAY TO THE PALACE
THEY WERE VERY OLD AND AS GREY-HEADED AS A PIGEON AND THE OLD WOMAN HAD SUCH A LONG NOSE THAT SHE SAT IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER AND USED IT TO STIR THE FIRE
FOR SLEIPNIR WAS THE HORSE OF ODIN THE GOD OF THE NORTH AND WAS AS SWIFT AS THE WIND
BUT THE OLD WOMAN SAID THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO HASTEN
SO HE TOOK BOTH THE GIRLS WITH HIM AND SET OUT
AH WELL
AH WELL
THE OLD KING NEARLY WENT OUT OF HIS MIND WITH JOY AT BEHOLDING HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN
BUT THE HORSE DEALER HAD NOT GOT VERY FAR WITH JACK BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS OWN FORM AGAIN AND WHEN THE MAN GOT HOME HE WAS SITTING ON THE BENCH BY THE STOVE
AND IN THIS ATTIRE CLIMBED INTO A GREAT MAPLE TREE WHICH STOOD IN THE PRIEST'S GARDEN
SUPPER WAS SOON SPREAD FOR HER UNDER A SHADY TREE AND SHE INVITED THE PRINCE TO SHARE THE CREAM AND BROWN BREAD WHICH THE OLD WOMAN PROVIDED
I WILL JUST HAVE A SHOT AT THAT DUCK SAID HE AND BEGAN TO AIM AT IT
WHEN IT WAS OVER AND THEY WERE PREPARING TO GO AWAY THE QUEEN SAID TO THEM
IF YOU WANT ME CALL FOR ME FIRST ANSWERED THE GIANT BRING ME MY MONEY BAGS THAT I MAY COUNT MY GOLDEN PIECES BEFORE I SLEEP THE GIANTESS OBEYED
NO I WON'T IT'S HARDLY ENOUGH FOR MYSELF
THEY ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF ZIZI.(21 21 CHARLES DEULIN CONTES DU ROI GAMBRINUS
HALVOR LONGED TO BUY IT AND BEGAN TO BARGAIN WITH THE MAN
THE KING AND HIS BRIDE DROVE TO CHURCH AND LITTLE SNOW WAS IN THE CARRIAGE TOO
MAY I HAVE LEAVE TO GO UP WITH THAT SAID KARI
I'VE ONLY GOT A CINDER-CAKE AND SOME SOUR BEER BUT IF YOU CARE TO HAVE THAT LET US SIT DOWN AND EAT SO THEY SAT DOWN AND WHEN DULLHEAD BROUGHT OUT HIS CAKE HE FOUND IT HAD TURNED INTO A FINE RICH CAKE AND THE SOUR BEER INTO EXCELLENT WINE
MIDNIGHT SOUNDED
SO THE MASTER THIEF WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE HER TO WIFE AND TOLD HIS FATHER THAT HE WAS TO GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND ASK FOR HIS DAUGHTER FOR HIM
AND FOR THAT VERY SAME REASON I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TALK MORE THAN YOU FOR I WAS A PRINCESS REPLIED THE GRASSHOPPER
AH NOW WE HAVE GOT THERE SAID MINNIKIN BUT HOW WE ARE TO GET BACK AGAIN IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING THEN HE TOOK THE CABLE AND TIED ONE END OF IT ROUND HIS BODY
HE ASKED HER NAME
YES NOW I SEE THE CASTLE QUITE NEAR AND NOW IT IS MUCH MUCH LARGER SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER
HE SPRANG TO THE GROUND FASTENED HIS HORSE TO A TREE AND SOON FOUND THE IRON GATE
ON HER SIDE SHE SEEMED QUITE BEWILDERED BUT SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH HAPPY EYES AND WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF HER DELIVERER
WELL SAID HE HOW ARE THE SHIFTS GETTING ON HERE MY LORD IS MY WEDDING GARMENT ANSWERED RENELDE SHOWING HIM THE SHIFT WHICH WAS THE FINEST AND WHITEST EVER SEEN
THE PRINCESSES BEGAN AT ONCE TO OPEN THEIR WARDROBES AND BOXES
HE BROUGHT ME THIS CHILD SAYS SHE I DO NOT KNOW WHERE HE GOT IT AND ORDERED ME TO MAKE IT INTO A PIE AND I CANNOT HELP CRYING AT THE COMMAND I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE KNEW OF ANY PLACE CONVENIENT THAT I COULD LEAVE THE CHILD SAFELY I WOULD DO IT RATHER THAN IT SHOULD BE KILLED BY SUCH A MONSTER
THE LAD ASKED FOR THESE THINGS AND OBTAINED THEM INSTANTLY FOR THE KING THOUGHT THAT FOR VERY SHAME HE COULD NOT REFUSE TO GIVE THEM AND SO DAPPLEGRIM GOT NEW SHOES AND THEY WERE GOOD ONES
BURCHARD FELL INTO SUCH A VIOLENT RAGE THAT IT NEARLY KILLED HIM
HOWEVER AFTER HIS LATE MISTAKE ABOUT THE COW HE THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER CONSULT HIS MOTHER FIRST
PUT YOUR BASKET ON THE TABLE AND THEN TAKE OFF YOUR FROCK AND COME AND LIE DOWN BY ME
THE PRINCESS WEPT AND BEGGED HIM MOST EARNESTLY NOT TO GO AND LEAVE HER
BUT SIGURD WOKE AND CAUGHT THE SWORD GRAM INTO HIS HAND AND THREW IT AT THE MAN AS HE FLED AND THE SWORD CUT HIM IN TWAIN
WHEN HE ENTERED THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENTS THEY BELIEVED THAT HE WAS MINNIKIN AND BOTH OF THEM RAN UP TO HIM AT ONCE
OH DON'T TAR AND FEATHER ME PLEASE
BUT WE WILL MAKE THIS TRIAL SINCE IT MUST BE SO SO THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS TO HIDE HERSELF FIRST
I WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR IT FOR IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU THINK SIR KNIGHT SAYS THE BLACK THIEF THAT THE DANGER I WAS IN SURPASSES THAT OF THIS YOUNG MAN WILL YOU PARDON HIM HIS CRIME I WILL SAYS THE KNIGHT SO GO ON WITH YOUR STORY I WAS SIR SAYS HE A VERY WILD BOY IN MY YOUTH AND CAME THROUGH MANY DISTRESSES
SO HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DO NOTHING THAT THEY DID NOT WISH
BUT THE QUEEN STILL LOOKED SAD AND THE KING ASKED HER AGAIN WHAT WAS THE MATTER
HE GUESSED WHAT THEY WERE AT SO HE FASTENED THE ROPE TO A STONE AND THEN GAVE IT A PULL
NO SAID HALVOR I WILL NOT GO UP THERE TILL EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING
I AM FROM TOWELLAND SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE DROPPED HER RIDING-WHIP AND WHILE THE PRINCE WAS STOOPING TO PICK IT UP SHE SAID
THE BLACK THIEF AND THE KING'S SONS THOUGHT TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BUT THEY WERE SUDDENLY SURROUNDED BY THE KNIGHT'S GUARDS AND TAKEN PRISONERS
BUT THE PEACOCKS WHO WERE SITTING UPON EVERY TREE WAITING TO SALUTE HER AND WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO CRY LONG LIVE OUR BEAUTIFUL QUEEN WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FALSE BRIDE COULD NOT HELP CRYING INSTEAD
THEREUPON OH DEAR
AH SAID THE QUEEN I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT THAT MEANS--YOU HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY
WE'LL VERY SOON SEE ABOUT THAT SO HE CALLED HIS GUARDS AND TOLD THEM TO GO AND FETCH DELICIA
RAPUNZEL RAPUNZEL LET DOWN YOUR GOLDEN HAIR AND AS SOON AS SHE HAD LET IT DOWN THE PRINCE CLIMBED UP
THERE HE SAW A MAN WHO WANTED TO GIVE HIS PIG SOME ACORNS TO EAT AND WAS TRYING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO MAKE HIM CLIMB UP THE OAK-TREE
I WORK FOR QUITE COMMON FOLKS SAYS HIS MASTER
THOU ART FAR TOO LITTLE FOR THAT SAID THE WOMAN
THE KING AND THE PRINCE WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WAS AS HANDSOME AS POSSIBLE
I MUST TRY AND FIND A COMPANION SO HE DREW OUT HIS FIDDLE AND FIDDLED AWAY LUSTILY
THE QUEEN WHEN SHE HEARD OF IT WAS FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER WITS AND BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY RUNNING AFTER A YOUNG FELLOW THROUGH THE FIELDS LIKE THAT
L
WHO LIVES SHALL SEE
SEARCH UNDER THE BUSH PRINCESS
WHERE ARE YOU
THE BOUGHS OF THE TREES HIT HER FACE AND THE SHRUBS TORE HER HANDS BUT ON SHE WENT AND NEVER LOOKED BACK
NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY WOKE UP THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS SHINING DOWN BRIGHT AND WARM INTO THE TREE
THEN GUNNAR REMEMBERED WITCHCRAFT THAT HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM AND BY HIS MAGIC HE MADE SIGURD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE HIMSELF AND HE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE GUNNAR
AT THE HEAD OF IT RODE FANFARONADE HIMSELF UPON A WHITE HORSE WHICH PRANCED AND CARACOLED TO THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPETS
SEE I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME MY WHITE AND YELLOW MUFF
PRINCE IVAN SAT DOWN ON THE STONE WEPT AND FELL ASLEEP
THE POOR BOY ENVIED THOSE HANDSOME YOUNG MEN WITH WHOM SHE DANCED SO GRACEFULLY BUT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW LITTLE REASON HE HAD TO BE JEALOUS OF THEM
I WILL GIVE THEE A SHIP WHICH CAN SAIL OVER FRESH WATER AND SALT WATER OVER HIGH HILLS AND DEEP DALES ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN
BUT SHE GAVE OUT THEY MUST GO AND BRING HER THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN'S WILD STEED OF BELLS OR THEY SHOULD LOSE THEIR HEADS
BUT I WILL NOT BEAR IT PROUD PRINCESS
BUT SHE SOON RECOVERED HER VOICE AND OVERWHELMED GRACIOSA WITH A TORRENT OF REPROACHES
IF SHE WERE TO KNOW ANY PEACE OF MIND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD CLIMB OVER THE GARDEN WALL AGAIN AND FETCH HER SOME MORE
THAT'S A REWARD FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD LITTLE MAID SAID MOTHER HOLLE AND SHE GAVE HER THE SPINDLE TOO THAT HAD FALLEN INTO THE WELL
THE BARBER DETERMINED NOT TO LOSE HIS RAZOR PURSUED THE MAN AND THEY BOTH CONTINUED RUNNING AT FULL SPEED TILL THEY HAD GOT WELL OUT OF THE TOWN WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MAN FELL HEAD FOREMOST DOWN A PRECIPICE AND NEVER WAS SEEN AGAIN
BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE AND THE KING BEHELD THE UGLY BRIDE WITH A NOSE THAT WAS FOUR ELLS LONG A JAW THAT WAS THREE ELLS AND A FOREHEAD THAT HAD A BUSH IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE WAS QUITE TERRIFIED
I AM LOST SAID DRAKESTAIL TO HIMSELF WHEN BY GOOD LUCK HE REMEMBERS HIS COMRADE FRIEND FOX AND HE CRIES
HER REAL NAME WAS BLANCHETTE BUT SHE WAS MORE OFTEN CALLED LITTLE GOLDEN-HOOD ON ACCOUNT OF A WONDERFUL LITTLE CLOAK WITH A HOOD GOLD AND FIRE-COLOURED WHICH SHE ALWAYS HAD ON
IF YOU WILL TAKE HER AND BRING HER UP FOR ME WHEN I AM RICH I WILL REWARD YOU SPLENDIDLY I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REWARD SAID THE OLD WOMAN BUT THERE IS ONE THING I SHOULD LIKE
WHEN THEY HAD LIVED A FEW YEARS HAPPILY TOGETHER THE KING'S MOTHER WHO WAS A WICKED OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO SLANDER THE YOUNG QUEEN AND SAID TO THE KING
BUT WHAT ERRAND HAVE YOU THAT CAN BRING YOU HERE
THE QUEEN WONDERED HOW SHE DARED OFFER HERSELF AND SHE WAS TOLD TO GO AWAY AS SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT DO
SISTER CRIED BITTERLY OVER HER POOR BEWITCHED BROTHER AND THE LITTLE ROE WEPT TOO AND SAT SADLY BY HER SIDE
HE BARKED SO LONG AND SO LOUD THAT HE WOKE ALL THE OTHER FISH WHO CAME SWIMMING UP ROUND THE PRINCESS'S BED AND POKING AT IT WITH THEIR GREAT HEADS
EACH OF THEM TURNED HER PALACE INTO AN EGG--FOR THEY WERE ALL ENCHANTRESSES--AND THEY TAUGHT HIM HOW TO TURN THE EGGS INTO PALACES AND BACK AGAIN AND THEY HANDED OVER THE EGGS TO HIM
LADY FRANCES BALFOUR HAS KINDLY COPIED AN OLD VERSION OF JACK AND THE BEANSTALK AND MESSRS
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY WISH FOR
WHEN HE COMES FIRE WILL SPURT OUT OF BOTH HIS NOSTRILS AND THEN THE TAR WILL CATCH FIRE
THAT IS ALL WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORESEE ABOUT YOUR DEAR LITTLE DAUGHTER
THEN THE EYES OF THE CRUEL QUEEN SPARKLED WITH GLEE AND LAUGHING ALOUD SHE CRIED
THE PIE ONLY SERVED TO SHARPEN HIS APPETITE AND I HEARD HIM SHARPENING HIS KNIFE AND SAYING HE MUST HAVE A COLLOP OR TWO FOR HE WAS NOT NEAR SATISFIED
HIS NEW WIFE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BUT SO PROUD AND OVERBEARING THAT SHE COULDN'T STAND ANY RIVAL TO HER BEAUTY
WHERE DOES THIS BRANCH COME FROM YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS KNOWS WELL ENOUGH ANSWERED MICHAEL
SO SHE RESOLVED TO CONSULT AN ENCHANTER OF WHOM SHE HAD HEARD A GREAT DEAL SINCE SHE HAD BEEN A SHEPHERDESS AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANYBODY SHE SET OUT TO FIND THE CASTLE IN WHICH HE LIVED WITH HIS SISTER WHO WAS A POWERFUL FAIRY
SO EVEN IF THE COUNT HAD REALLY WISHED TO MARRY RENELDE SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE REFUSED
IMMEDIATELY THEY COCKED UP THEIR TAILS AND DISPERSED AMONG THE THICK FORESTS
YET I THOUGHT SHE SAID THAT NO MAN COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEED BUT SIGURD FAFNIR'S BANE WHO WAS MY TRUE LOVE
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT I WAS JUST WANTING A MAN OF THAT KIND WELL BUT I DIDN'T LET HIM GO AFTER ALL SAID THE PRINCESS
THEN HE WANDERED BLIND AND MISERABLE THROUGH THE WOOD EATING NOTHING BUT ROOTS AND BERRIES AND WEEPING AND LAMENTING THE LOSS OF HIS LOVELY BRIDE
LET ME HAVE A DROP
THEY LIFTED HER UP AND LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE TO SEE IF THEY COULD FIND ANYTHING POISONOUS ABOUT
MOE
MOE
MOE
MOE
MOE
AND NOW HE WANTS TO MARRY ME BUT THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO UPON HEARING THIS THE FAIRY BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE LITTLE TURKEY-MAIDEN WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE PRINCESS DELICIA
MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO BRING THE PRINCES OUT OF PRISON AND THEY CAME VERY SADLY BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE TO BE EXECUTED AT ONCE
BUT THE PRINCE HAD HAD THE THRESHOLD SMEARED WITH TAR AND AS SHE FLED HER GOLD SLIPPERS STUCK TO IT
THE KING WAS SULKY AND SAVAGE AND NEVER ENJOYED HIMSELF AT ALL
ARRIVED THERE HE TURNED ROUND
BUT YOU SHALL GO TO THE THIRD AND DO WHAT SHE BIDS YOU
WHEN THOSE WHO WERE IN THE KING'S PALACE SAW THE SHIP THEY LOST NO TIME IN GOING TO MEET HIM WITH SONG AND MUSIC AND THUS THEY MARCHED UP TOWARDS MINNIKIN WITH GREAT REJOICINGS
WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE CHRISTENING OF THE PRINCESS THE QUEEN--AS SHE ALWAYS DID--SENT FOR ALL THE FAIRIES TO BE PRESENT AT THE CEREMONY AND AFTERWARDS INVITED THEM TO A SPLENDID BANQUET
THE KING WAS STANDING OUTSIDE ON THE STEPS AND ASKED WHERE HE WAS GOING
WHAT WOULD BE THE USE OF THAT SAID THE OTHERS WHO WERE IN THE KITCHEN
WHAT BECAME OF THE TWO ELDER I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER BUT THE YOUNGEST WENT BOTH FAR AND WIDE
WHEN THE EAGLE HAD HAD PLENTY OF FOOD AND REST THE OLD WOMAN PLUCKED A FEATHER OUT OF ITS TAIL AND SET THE MAN IN THE FEATHER'S PLACE AND THEN THE BIRD FLEW AWAY WITH HIM BUT THEY DID NOT GET TO FARMER WEATHERBEARD'S BEFORE MIDNIGHT
AND YOU WHAT WILL YOU BE CALLED I WILL BE CALLED KING PIPPIN ANSWERED THE ELDER
THE FALCON SMOTE UPON THE GROUND BECAME A BRAVE YOUTH AND SAID
WHEN IT GOT QUITE DARK THE MASTERS OF THE LITTLE HOUSE RETURNED
THEN IN COMMANDING TONES THE ELDEST SISTER GAVE HIM THE ORDER THEY HAD AGREED UPON
YOU MUST ASK FOR TEN POUNDS OF IRON AND TWELVE POUNDS OF STEEL FOR THE SHOEING AND ONE SMITH TO HAMMER AND ONE TO HOLD SO THE YOUTH DID THIS AND NO ONE SAID HIM NAY
ON HE WENT ONE DAY ON HE WENT ANOTHER DAY AND BY THE DAWN OF THE THIRD DAY HE SAW A PALACE STILL GRANDER THAN THE FORMER ONE AND HARD BY THE PALACE STOOD AN OAK AND ON THE OAK SAT AN EAGLE
EVERYBODY SAID SHE WAS THE HAPPIEST PRINCESS IN THE WORLD
INTO EACH OF THESE HE ENTERED TOOK THE MAIDENS ROBES WENT OUT AGAIN TURNED THE PALACES BACK INTO EGGS AND WENT HOME
WHEN WE ENTER INTO THIS WOOD YOU MUST FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING AT ALL AND NOT TO PLUCK OFF EVEN SO MUCH AS ONE LEAF OR ELSE ALL WILL BE OVER BOTH WITH YOU AND WITH ME
THEN HE ENGAGED ELEVEN MEN TO LIE THAT NIGHT IN HIDING BEHIND THE GOVERNOR'S STABLE
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE EAGLE SAID
SHAME ON YOU THUS TO SMITE THE BELOVED OF MY HEART
LET US SEE WHO THIS CREATURE WAS
THEREFORE THEY DEMANDED SEVEN DAYS IN WHICH TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE WOULD HARDLY EVEN GRANT THEM THIS FAVOUR BUT AT LAST HE WAS PERSUADED TO DO SO
PRINCESS ANNA COME FORTH QUICKLY I OUR BROTHER IS COMING OUT RAN THE PRINCESS ANNA GREETED HIM JOYFULLY AND BEGAN KISSING AND EMBRACING HIM ASKING AFTER HIS HEALTH AND TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT HERSELF
SHE TOO SAID WHAT THE OTHERS HAD SAID THAT NO CHRISTIAN FOLK HAD EVER BEEN THERE SINCE SHE HAD COME AND ENTREATED HIM TO GO AWAY AGAIN OR ELSE THE TROLL WOULD SWALLOW HIM UP ALIVE
MY CHILD WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IN THE WIDE WORLD ARE YOU DOING HERE I AM ONLY A POOR GIRL SHE ANSWERED AND AM RINSING OUT MY YARN IN THE RIVER THEN THE KING WAS SORRY FOR HER AND WHEN HE SAW HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS HE SAID
SHE'S SURELY MORE MONEY THAN WIT TO THROW GOLD ABOUT LIKE THAT SAID HER STEPSISTER BUT IN HER SECRET HEART SHE WAS VERY JEALOUS AND DETERMINED THAT SHE TOO WOULD GO TO THE WOOD AND LOOK FOR STRAWBERRIES
LIE DOWN ON THE BENCH AND SLEEP A LITTLE FOR WE HAVE NO BED TO OFFER YOU SAID SHE AND I WILL WATCH FOR THE COMING OF THE WEST WIND ERE LONG CAME THE WEST WIND ROARING SO LOUD THAT THE WALLS CREAKED
THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF AND EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE WAS IN THE KITCHEN KEEPING WATCH OVER THE JOINT
BUT HALVOR SAID LET HIM COME WHEN HE WILL SO SHE GAVE HIM THE TROLL'S SWORD AND BADE HIM TAKE A DRINK FROM THE FLASK TO ENABLE HIM TO WIELD IT
WHEN THE EAGLE HAD FLOWN A LONG WAY IT ALIGHTED ON A STONE
HOWEVER THEY COULD NOT RETRACT THE BARGAIN AND THE YOUNGEST PRINCE WAS DESIRED TO TELL WHAT DEMAND HE HAD ON THE QUEEN AS HE HAD WON HIS GAME
HERE IS HE WHO BROUGHT US OUT OF THE OTHER WORLD
AND THEN THE GIANTESS OPENED THE DOOR AND MADE JACK COME OUT TO HELP HER
NOW BRYNHILD HAD NO HELP BUT TO PROMISE SHE WOULD BE HIS WIFE THE WIFE OF GUNNAR AS SHE SUPPOSED FOR SIGURD WORE GUNNAR'S SHAPE AND SHE HAD SWORN TO WED WHOEVER SHOULD RIDE THE FLAMES
WELL THE MASTER THIEF THOUGHT HE MIGHT IF HE COULD HEAR WHAT IT WAS
HIS WIFE STOOD BEFORE HIM ONCE MORE ALIVE AND AS BLOOMING AS EVER
WHY DID YOU DISOBEY ME AND GO LOOKING INTO THE CLOSET AND LETTING OUT KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS FORGIVE ME MARYA MOREVNA
NO I SEE NOTHING BUT THE SKY ABOVE AND THE WILD FELL SIDE SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER
AND HE FED FROM HER HAND AND PLAYED ROUND HER AND SEEMED QUITE HAPPY
HERE LITTLE ONE EAT IT UP
FIRST THEY WENT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PAST THE TRUNK OF THE BIRCH TREE AND THEN PAST THE OLD HAG WHO SAT IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK SPINNING AND THEY WENT BY SO FAST THAT CINDERLAD COULD NOT HEAR WHAT THE OLD HAG SCREECHED AFTER HIM BUT JUST HEARD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS TERRIBLY ENRAGED
THE THREE PRINCES LIVED HAPPY AND WELL DURING THEIR FATHER'S REIGN AND ALWAYS KEEPING THE BLACK THIEF ALONG WITH THEM
TO WORK
THEY WERE GREAT BLACK CREATURES THAT RAN BOLDLY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT THROUGH THE STREETS AND SWARMED SO ALL OVER THE HOUSES THAT PEOPLE AT LAST COULD NOT PUT THEIR HAND OR FOOT DOWN ANYWHERE WITHOUT TOUCHING ONE
I ACCEPTED GLADLY NOT KNOWING THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO SEE HIM DAY BY DAY
ONCE SHE INQUIRED WHAT THE GIRLS IN HIS COUNTRY WERE LIKE
WHAT PUNISHMENT DOES THAT PERSON DESERVE WHO DRAGS ANOTHER OUT OF BED AND THROWS HIM OR HER AS THE CASE MAY BE INTO THE WATER THEN THE WICKED OLD STEPMOTHER ANSWERED
SO THEY SET OUT AND ASKED EVERYONE THEY MET DO YOU KNOW THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS BUT THE ANSWER WAS ALWAYS NO NO THEN THEY WENT ON AND ON SO FAR THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN FARTHER AND AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE KINGDOM OF THE COCKCHAFERS
YOU MUST KNOW THAT I AM VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT WHAT I EAT AND IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT I FANCY ABOVE ALL OTHERS IT IS A PLUMP TENDER LITTLE MOUSE
AS WE HAD TO MAKE SUCH HASTE AND HAD NO TIME TO DO IT AT HOME WE MAY AS WELL DO IT HERE SAID HE
WHEN THE WOMAN PUTS OFF HER REINDEER SKIN I SHALL COMB HER HEAD FOR HER
SO THE ACCUSATION WAS DRAWN UP AGAINST THEM THAT THEY WERE IMPOSTORS AND THAT THEY HAD PROMISED THE KING A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN MARRIAGE WHO WHEN SHE ARRIVED PROVED TO BE AN UGLY PEASANT GIRL
CLEARLY HER HUSBAND MUST BE BEWITCHED
IF THOU CANST FIND HER EACH TIME THAT SHE HIDES HERSELF AND IF SHE CANNOT FIND THEE IN THY HIDING-PLACES THEN IT IS FATED AND THOU SHALT HAVE THE PRINCESS THAT TOO WAS NOT IN OUR BARGAIN SAID THE YOUTH
I WILL GIVE THE ELDER GIRL WORK TO KEEP HER FROM BEING DULL IN OUR ABSENCE SO THE MAN TOOK THE CHILD AND SET OUT
BEASTS OF PREY CAME RUNNING AT US FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD AND ALL BUT TORE US UTTERLY TO PIECES WELL TO-MORROW RUN OFF INTO THE BLUE SEA AGAIN DID PRINCE IVAN SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT
THEN HE WADED INTO THE WATER UP TO HIS CHIN AND AFTER BEING NEARLY DROWNED ONCE OR TWICE HE AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HOLD OF THE PRINCESS'S BED AND DRAGGING IT ON SHORE
I WILL GIVE THEE A SWORD WHICH IS SUCH A SWORD THAT IT CAN CONQUER A WHOLE ARMY LET IT BE EVER SO GREAT REPLIED THE WOMAN
THEN HE IS A SORCERER CRIED THE CITIZENS WITH ONE VOICE
TAKE COURAGE PRETTY PRINCESS ALL IS NOT LOST YET
AT LENGTH THE QUEEN HAVING SOME BUSINESS WITH THE HEN-WIFE WENT HERSELF TO HER AND AFTER A LONG CONFERENCE PASSED WAS TAKING LEAVE OF HER WHEN THE HEN-WIFE PRAYED THAT IF EVER SHE SHOULD COME BACK TO HER AGAIN SHE MIGHT BREAK HER NECK
GIVE HER THIS BRUSH
RECOVERING MYSELF THEREFORE FROM THE FEAR I WAS IN I VENTURED TO THE UPPER END OF THE VAULT WHERE I FOUND A LARGE BUNDLE AND UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT THE CORPSE WAS ALREADY RIFLED AND THAT WHICH I HAD TAKEN TO BE A GHOST WAS NO MORE THAN ONE OF HIS OWN CLERGY
FOR HE HAD MADE UP HIS OWN MIND THAT WHEN HE OR ANY OF HIS FAMILY HEARD THAT VOICE THEY WOULD PAY NO HEED TO IT HOWEVER LOUDLY IT CALLED
WHEN HE HAD GOT SOME DISTANCE HE HAD TO GO INTO AN INN TO GET SOME MORE BRANDY
WE NEVER SAW YOU I HID MYSELF REPLIED THE STAR GAZER QUIETLY
YOU STAND BEHIND ME SAID SHE AND I WILL HOLD THE CARBUNCLE WHICH WILL MAKE US INVISIBLE AND WITH THE KING'S DAGGER I CAN PROTECT YOU FROM THE ENEMY SO WHEN THE SOLDIERS LANDED THEY COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE PRINCESS TOUCHED THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER WITH THE DAGGER AND THEY FELL INSENSIBLE UPON THE SAND SO THAT AT LAST THE ADMIRAL SEEING THAT THERE WAS SOME ENCHANTMENT HASTILY GAVE ORDERS FOR A RETREAT TO BE SOUNDED AND GOT HIS MEN BACK INTO THEIR BOATS IN GREAT CONFUSION
BUT HE TOOK HEART AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIS DAUGHTERS WHO LOOKED FRIGHTENED TO DEATH
I AM WHOLLY AT A LOSS IN WHAT MANNER TO ACT IN THIS AFFAIR YOU MUST MAKE KNOWN TO THE KING SAYS THE HEN-WIFE THAT YOU HEARD OF HIS SONS AND WONDER GREATLY THAT HE CONCEALED THEM ALL THIS TIME FROM YOU
ONCE WHEN MY FATHER WAS FIGHTING AGAINST SOME DRAGONS WHO WERE THE SCOURGE OF OUR COUNTRY I SLEW THE YOUNGEST DRAGON
ONE WAS BANDY-LEGGED AND COULD NOT RUN FAST ENOUGH
AT LAST THE STAR GAZER PERCEIVED A LARGE LAKE AND ON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE TWELVE LITTLE BOATS WITH AWNINGS IN WHICH WERE SEATED TWELVE PRINCES WHO GRASPING THEIR OARS AWAITED THE PRINCESSES
SEEING THEY DID NOT APPEAR IN ANY FORMIDABLE SHAPE I WAS MORE THAN ONCE RESOLVED TO ATTACK THEM THINKING THAT WITH MY BROAD SWORD I COULD EASILY DESTROY THEM
THERE HE ASKED FOR A PLACE AND GOT IT
I AM THE QUEEN OF THE COMETS AND CAN BRING YOU TO GREAT HONOUR IF YOU WILL MARRY ME MARRY YOU MADAM CRIED THE PRINCE IN HORROR
CAN THIS REALLY BE MY POOR LITTLE SELF SHE EXCLAIMED LOOKING DOWN IN AMAZEMENT AT HER TINY WORN-OUT CRUTCH AS IT LAY UPON THE FLOOR
THE NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT ONE OF THE SERVANTS AT THE CASTLE WHO HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE CAME TO TELL THE POOR LADY OF THE SAD FATE OF HER HUSBAND AND HER PRETTY BABES
HIS MOTHER WHO WAS A WITCH CAST A SPELL OVER ME AND CHANGED ME INTO A PIG
BROTHER WOLF COME TO MY RESCUE THE MUSICIAN HAS DECEIVED ME TOO THE WOLF PULLED THE BRANCHES DOWN BIT THE CORD IN TWO AND SET THE FOX FREE
I SEE A FLOCK OF CROWS COMING FLYING AFTER US SAID THE MAN
AS SOON AS THE LIGHTS WERE OUT THESE UNTIRING NIBBLERS SET TO WORK
BUT HE WENT ON AND AT LAST HE SAW A LIGHT FAR AWAY IN THE WOOD
THEN HE STAMPED OFF TAKING THE FAIRY WITH HIM AND LEAVING THE POOR QUEEN IN TEARS
I CAN'T KEEP STILL ANY LONGER AND HE BEGGED AND PRAYED TILL AT LAST SHE CONSENTED
THE FOALS CAME BACK IN THE EVENING AND THEN HE TOO GOT A BIT OF MOSS AND A BOTTLE OF WATER FROM THE OLD HAG WHICH THINGS HE WAS TO SHOW TO THE KING
THE MAN'S DAUGHTER WEPT AND WAS SORELY TROUBLED FOR LITTLE SNOW WAS THE DEAREST THING SHE HAD ON EARTH BUT AT LAST SHE THREW HIM OVERBOARD
IT WILL HELP TO MAKE YOU STRONG AGAIN
IT IS ONLY A NAIL WHICH CAUGHT YOU VII THEY WENT DOWN DOWN DOWN TILL AT LAST THEY CAME TO A PASSAGE WITH A DOOR AT ONE END WHICH WAS ONLY FASTENED WITH A LATCH
THERE MOTHER I HAVE BROUGHT YOU THE GOLD THAT MY FATHER LOST OH JACK
AFTERWARDS THE PRINCE HEAPED UP A PILE OF WOOD SET FIRE TO IT BURNT KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS ON THE PYRE AND SCATTERED HIS ASHES TO THE WIND
HE KNOCKS LOUDER
PERHAPS I COULD BEAR EVEN THAT IF I HAD ANY MONEY BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THE EXPENSES OF THE WEDDING HAVE COMPLETELY RUINED ME
AT LAST ONE DAY THE WICKED WOMAN TOOK A LARGE POT PUT IT ON THE FIRE AND BOILED SOME YARN IN IT
TAKE YOU THE LITTLE ONE
MY LITTLE LAMBKIN ARE YOU WILLING TO MARRY THE GREAT KING MERLIN'S SON FOR THIS AMBASSADOR HAS COME ON HIS BEHALF TO FETCH YOU IF YOU PLEASE SIRE SAID THE PRINCESS DROPPING A CURTSEY
GOLD SHALL DROP FROM HER MOUTH WHENEVER SHE SPEAKS SAID THE THIRD HEAD
THEN CAME THE LOVELY MAIDEN AND GOT THE BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR TILL THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT AND THEN SHE SENT HER LITTLE SNOW OUT TO SEE IF IT WOULD SOON BE DAY AND THIS SHE DID THREE TIMES
LONG AFTER THE OTHERS THERE CAME AN OLD EAGLE
ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE LET THE GREEDY OLD WOMAN HAVE YOU AND EAT YOU UP BUT I COULD NOT BEAR TO DO IT WHEREUPON THE MOUSE ANSWERED
SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER EYES OFF HIM AND THERE SHE STOOD ENTRANCED UNTIL THE KING AND THE PRINCE CAME UP AND ASKED WHAT WAS AMUSING HER SO MUCH
AND HE FITTED IN THE LITTLE KEY AND TURNED IT
FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS SHE STRUGGLED THROUGH IT BUT COULD FIND NOTHING
YOU HAVE THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER FOR A WIFE NOW AND THE WITCH HERSELF FOR A MOTHER-IN-LAW IS THERE ANY WAY OF GETTING MY OWN WIFE BACK FROM THE WOOD AGAIN ASKED THE PRINCE
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN OF USE TO US AND WE WILL NOT LET YOU GO WITHOUT A RECOMPENSE AND HE OFFERED HIM FIFTY CROWNS
SO THE PRINCESS TOOK HEART WHEN SHE SAW HOW KINDLY SHE WAS TREATED AND ASKED
AT LAST THE GIRL SAID
I AM CERTAINLY MUCH TOO PRETTY TO BE THEIR WATER CARRIER SO SAYING SHE BROKE HER PITCHER AND WENT HOME
BUT AS THE UGLY ONE WAS HER OWN DAUGHTER SHE LIKED HER FAR THE BEST OF THE TWO AND THE PRETTY ONE HAD TO DO ALL THE WORK OF THE HOUSE AND WAS IN FACT THE REGULAR MAID OF ALL WORK
MY MOTHER
IF YOU ARE OF THE SAME MIND WITH ME WE WILL TAKE OUR DEPARTURE THIS VERY NIGHT THE KING'S DAUGHTER THOUGHT THAT IT WAS BAD TO GO AND LEAVE HER FATHER BUT THAT IT WAS WORSE STILL TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH THE QUEEN SO SHE PROMISED THE BULL THAT SHE WOULD COME
THE GIRL WISHING TO PLEASE HER BROTHERS PLUCKED THE TWELVE FLOWERS MEANING TO PRESENT ONE TO EACH OF THEM AS THEY SAT AT SUPPER
I SHALL LOCK MY DOOR FAST FOR FEAR OF THOSE WILD HUNTSMEN
AND NOW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO OPEN HER MOUTH AND SPEAK SHE TOLD THE KING WHY SHE HAD BEEN DUMB AND NOT ABLE TO LAUGH
AND NO DOUBT WENT ON THE PRINCESS ONE OF THEM IS YOUR INTENDED BRIDE STILL HE WAS SILENT AND ZIZI DREW HERSELF UP PROUDLY
BUT AS HE WAS VERY WEAK AND UNABLE TO WALK HE HAD HIMSELF BORNE IN A LITTER
THE NEXT DAY THE WHEEL WAS MENDED AND THE SPINNER SAT DOWN TO SPIN
AFTER THE CHRISTENING HE SAID
BEFORE I CAME AS A GUEST BUT NOW I HAVE COME AS A WOOER
BEFORE I CAME AS A GUEST BUT NOW I HAVE COME AS A WOOER
I AM DYING OF THIRST
WE MUST GO AND HARANGUE THE PEOPLE SO SHE WALKED FIRST LOOKING VERY SERIOUS AND DIGNIFIED AND WEARING A DRESS THE TRAIN OF WHICH WAS AT LEAST TEN ELLS LONG
IF HE SEES YOU HE WILL CERTAINLY WISH TO MARRY YOU OH NO CRIED ROSETTE HE MUST BE WICKED SINCE HE TRIED TO DROWN ME
AS THERE WAS NO WIND AT ALL THEY LAY THERE BECALMED AND HALVOR ASKED THE SKIPPER TO GIVE HIM LEAVE TO GO ON SHORE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM FOR HE WOULD MUCH RATHER DO THAT THAN LIE THERE AND SLEEP
NOW IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT A PRINCE CAME TO THE WOOD AND PASSED BY THE DWARFS HOUSE
NO PRINCE EQUALLED HIM IN CLEVERNESS AND KINDNESS OF HEART BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS MOST TERRIBLY UGLY
THERE LIES REGIN READY TO BETRAY SIGURD WHO TRUSTS HIM THE THIRD BIRD SAID
BUT WHATSOEVER YOU DRINK AND WHATSOEVER YOU DO DON'T FORGET TO TAKE THE HALTER OFF ME OR YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME MORE AND THUS IT HAPPENED
DON'T MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE AGAIN
AT LAST HE FLUNG HIM INTO THE GOVERNOR'S GOOSE-HOUSE AND THE GEESE BEGAN TO HISS AND PECK AT HIM TILL HE FELT MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
NOW THE PRINCESSES WERE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK ESPECIALLY THE ELDEST AND THIS IS WHAT SHE READ
RUBBISH
THEIR MAJESTIES WERE OVERJOYED AT THE NEWS AND THE KING SENT FOR A GREAT BOOK EACH LEAF OF WHICH WAS EIGHT ELLS LONG
THREE DAYS PASSED BEFORE THEY HEARD ANY NEWS AND THEN THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS CAME AND BERATED THEM THROUGH A HOLE IN THE WALL
THE MAN WAS NOT OVERPLEASED AT THIS
THE ROGUE OF A BOATMAN WHO NOTICED ALL THIS SAID SOFTLY TO THE NURSE
WHEN YOU HAVE GOT THERE JUST TURN THE SHOES SO THAT THE TOES POINT THIS WAY AND THEN THEY WILL COME HOME AGAIN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WHEN THE KING ARRIVED THERE HE TURNED THE SHOES AS THE LORD OF THE BEASTS HAD BIDDEN HIM AND THEY WENT BACK
ALL AT ONCE SHE BECAME AWARE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALONE FOR BEHIND HER STOOD A TINY OLD WOMAN IN A CAP WHO WAS AS UGLY AGAIN AS HERSELF AND QUITE AS LAME
AND EVERY DAY BURCHARD GREW WORSE AND WATCHED HIS END APPROACHING
SIGURD TRIED THIS BLADE ON THE LUMP OF IRON AND IT DID NOT BREAK BUT SPLIT THE IRON IN TWO
PERHAPS HIS HEART MAY BE SOFTENED SO THEY WAITED FOR ONE MONTH FOR TWO FOR SIX FOR A YEAR
I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN HOW YOU DO IT NOTHING EASIER SAID THE MUSICIAN IF YOU'LL PROMISE TO DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU CERTAINLY ANSWERED THE FOX YOU HAVE ONLY TO SAY THE WORD WELL THEN FOLLOW ME REPLIED THE FIDDLER
FIRST FAFNIR THE DRAGON KILLED HIS OWN FATHER AND THEN HE WENT AND WALLOWED ON THE GOLD AND WOULD LET HIS BROTHER HAVE NONE AND NO MAN DARED GO NEAR IT
SHE HAD HARDLY GOT INSIDE THE DOOR WHEN SHE WAS SEIZED BY FOUR WAITING WOMEN WHO LOOKED SO TALL AND STRONG AND CRUEL THAT THE PRINCESS SHUDDERED AT THE SIGHT OF THEM AND STILL MORE WHEN SHE SAW THEM ARMING THEMSELVES WITH GREAT BUNDLES OF RODS AND HEARD THE DUCHESS CALL OUT TO THEM FROM HER BED TO BEAT THE PRINCESS WITHOUT MERCY
WHO IN THE WORLD DO THESE SHIRTS BELONG TO
HE WENT WITH THEM TILL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THREE ROADS MET AND THERE EACH OF THEM TOOK HIS OWN WAY AND THE FATHER BADE THEM FAREWELL AND RETURNED TO HIS OWN HOME AGAIN
I DO NOT KNOW THAT HE ANSWERED BUT I WILL ASK MY BEASTS THEN HE BLEW HIS HORN AND INQUIRED WHETHER ANY OF THEM KNEW WHERE WHITELAND LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE WHO KNEW THAT
WELL HERE IS A BUCKET THAT WILL NOT BREAK THE GYPSY RETURNED TO THE FOUNTAIN AND ADDRESSING ONCE MORE THE IMAGE OF ZIZI SHE SAID
BUT YOU MIGHT LOOK NICER THAN YOU DO IN THAT OLD GOWN WHICH IS ONLY FIT FOR A KITCHEN-MAID
WHO'S BEEN EATING OUT OF MY LITTLE PLATE THE FIFTH SAID
BUT HALVOR WAS SO RAGGED AND TORN WITH FOLLOWING THE WEST WIND THROUGH BUSHES AND BOGS THAT HE KEPT ON ONE SIDE AND WOULD NOT GO AMONG THE CROWD UNTIL THE LAST DAY WHEN THE FEAST WAS TO BE HELD AT NOON
NO HE SAID AT LAST
BUT NOW LET US SIT DOWN AND SEE WHAT KIND OF FOOD OUR MOTHER HAS GIVEN US AND THAT THEY DID
THE KING HAS CALLED ALL THE WORKMEN TOGETHER BUT NOT ONE OF THEM WILL UNDERTAKE TO DO IT THE PRINCE HAVING HEARD ALL THIS SAID GO TO THE KING MASTER AND TELL HIM THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE EVERYTHING THAT'S IN YOUR LINE HOWEVER CAN I UNDERTAKE TO MAKE CLOTHES OF THAT SORT
OUT OF IT FLEW THE PRETTIEST LITTLE FEMALE CANARY THAT EVER WAS SEEN
THIS LITTLE HOOD WAS GIVEN HER BY HER GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS SO OLD THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER AGE
SMITH AND ELDER HAVE PERMITTED THE PUBLICATION OF TWO OF MR RALSTON'S VERSIONS FROM THE RUSSIAN
AS LONG AS THEY DID THIS ALL WENT WELL WITH THEM
AT DAYBREAK HE SET OFF AGAIN FOR HE DID NOT FEEL AS IF HE COULD TAKE ANY REST
I WISH THAT PAGE IN GREEN TO COME AND LEAD THE HORSE AS HE DID WHEN GRACIOSA RODE IT SAID SHE VERY SHARPLY
THEN THE HUNTSMAN STOLE AFTER IT AS FAR AS THE LITTLE HOUSE AND HEARD IT CALL OUT MY SISTER DEAR OPEN
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEE THEN CARRY ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD HE REPLIED
THE WICKED QUEEN WAS STANDING ALL THIS TIME ON THE TOWER AND HEARING THE BELLS RINGING AT A GREAT DISTANCE OFF KNEW VERY WELL IT WAS THE PRINCES COMING HOME AND THE STEED WITH THEM AND THROUGH SPITE AND VEXATION PRECIPITATED HERSELF FROM THE TOWER AND WAS SHATTERED TO PIECES
WHICH BY THE SOUND OF THE BELLS NOT ONLY ALARMS THE PRINCE AND HIS GUARDS BUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ROUND SO THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE EVER TO GET HIM AND THOSE THAT ARE SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO BE TAKEN BY THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN ARE BOILED IN A RED-HOT FIERY FURNACE BLESS ME SAYS THE YOUNG PRINCE WHAT WILL WE DO
THE PRINCE DID NOT SEE HER AND THINKING IT WAS A DOG HE GAVE HER SUCH A PUSH WITH HIS FOOT THAT HER ARM WAS BROKEN
AH PRINCE IVAN
OFTEN THE KING SAID TO THE QUEEN
LET US FLY MARYA MOREVNA AH PRINCE IVAN
LET US FLY MARYA MOREVNA AH PRINCE IVAN
BUT THE SEVENTH DWARF SLEPT WITH HIS COMPANIONS ONE HOUR IN EACH BED AND IN THIS WAY HE MANAGED TO PASS THE NIGHT
BUT ON THE SECOND DAY SHE BEGAN TO BE LAZY AND ON THE THIRD SHE WOULDN'T EVEN GET UP IN THE MORNING
SO CINDERLAD TOLD HIM WHENCE HE CAME AND THAT HE WAS BROTHER TO THE TWO WHO HAD WATCHED THE SEVEN FOALS FOR THE KING AND THEN HE INQUIRED IF HE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO TRY TO WATCH THEM ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
AND THEN PEALS OF MOCKING LAUGHTER RANG THROUGH THE AIR AND THEY GUESSED THAT THIS WAS ANOTHER OF THE FAIRY CARABOSSE'S UNPLEASANT JOKES
WHEN THEY REACHED THE CITY THEY FOUND IT FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE DRESSED ENTIRELY IN PEACOCKS FEATHERS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY THOUGHT PRETTIER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WITHOUT IN THE LEAST EXPECTING AN ANSWER THE PRINCE ASKED IT
AND HE GAVE HER A RING AND SHE GAVE HIM BACK THE RING HE HAD GIVEN HER BEFORE IN HIS OWN SHAPE AS SIGURD AND IT WAS THE LAST RING OF THAT POOR DWARF ANDVARI
HE CHANGED CLOTHES WITH HIS BROTHER AND WENT INTO THE PALACE
BELIEVE ME MADAM YOU WILL NEVER REPENT OF YOUR KINDNESS THE QUEEN WAS IMMENSELY ASTONISHED WHEN THE MOUSE BEGAN TO SPEAK AND STILL MORE SO WHEN SHE SAW ITS LITTLE SHARP NOSE TURN TO A BEAUTIFUL FACE AND ITS PAWS TO HANDS AND FEET
IN THE EVENING HE CAME TO A GREEN FIELD WHERE STOOD A GREAT TREE UNDER WHICH HE SEATED HIMSELF
BUT HE WOULD NOT LET HER GO AND HAD ALL THE DOORS OF THE HOUSE SHUT AND BOLTED
NOW SAYS HE WE MUST STAY HERE TILL NIGHT COMES
III IT WAS WELL KNOWN FOR FULL TWENTY MILES ROUND THAT THERE LIVED IN THE CASTLE OF BELOEIL TWELVE PRINCESSES OF WONDERFUL BEAUTY AND AS PROUD AS THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL AND WHO WERE BESIDES SO VERY SENSITIVE AND OF SUCH TRULY ROYAL BLOOD THAT THEY WOULD HAVE FELT AT ONCE THE PRESENCE OF A PEA IN THEIR BEDS EVEN IF THE MATTRESSES HAD BEEN LAID OVER IT
I SHALL BE SUFFICIENTLY REPAID BY KNOWING THAT YOU ARE HAPPY
IT WAS THE WORK OF A VERY CLEVER FAIRY AND CONTAINED A DESCRIPTION OF THE WHOLE EARTH
PRAY MADAM HOW LONG DO YOU MEAN TO STAY HERE
SO THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT HE WOULD DO HIS VERY BEST AND THE MASTER THIEF GOT ON THE GOVERNOR'S HORSE
FOR AS SOON AS THE STONE WAS LIFTED HIGH ENOUGH SHE GAVE THE PRINCESS A PUSH WHICH SENT HER DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL AND THEN THE STONE WAS LET FALL AGAIN AND THERE SHE WAS A PRISONER
THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM EVERYTHING WEEPING BITTERLY AGAIN AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS BY THE KING'S ORDERS THAT SHE HAD BEEN THROWN OVERBOARD
THE RATS WERE FOLLOWING
THEY WERE BOTH GOOD CHILDREN AND LOVED EACH OTHER WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS
SHE IS AS ANGRY AS EVER WHILE SHE LAMENTED IN THIS WAY AND EVERYBODY WAS AS WET AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH A RIVER THE PRINCESS STILL THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE AMBASSADOR AND JUST AT THIS MOMENT HE APPEARED BEFORE HER WITH THE KING AND THERE WAS A GREAT BLOWING OF TRUMPETS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHOUTED LOUDER THAN EVER
EVERY DRAWER WAS MADE OF CRYSTAL OF AMBER OR OF SOME PRECIOUS STONE AND WAS QUITE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF TREASURE
BUT THE SECOND SON SPOKE MOST SENSIBLY TOO AND SAID
AND SIGURD WENT TO THE WOOD AND THERE HE MET AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD AND SAID COME
QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I HAVE MY MONEY BACK HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE MET HIS LADY-FRIEND LADDER LEANING ON HER WALL
WELL I HAVEN'T THE SMALLEST DESIRE FOR HIS COMPANY THE FOX CAME STRAIGHT UP TO HIM AND SAID
KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS WAS RETURNING HOME WHEN HIS GOOD STEED STUMBLED BENEATH HIM
MY HORSE IS SO WELL BROKEN IN THAT IT WILL STAND STILL WHEN I BID IT SO THEY ALL HASTENED INTO THE CHURCH TOGETHER AND THE PRIEST GOT INTO THE PULPIT BUT NO ONE LISTENED TO WHAT HE SAID FOR THEY WERE LOOKING FAR TOO MUCH AT HER AND WONDERING WHENCE SHE CAME
SO ONE MORNING SHE SAID TO HER SON I AM TOO WEAK TO GO MYSELF JACK SO YOU MUST TAKE THE COW TO MARKET FOR ME AND SELL HER JACK LIKED GOING TO MARKET TO SELL THE COW VERY MUCH
WHEN SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE HORSE THE PRINCE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE CHURCH AND ASKED HER WHENCE SHE CAME
SHE PROCEEDED TO TELL ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER AND WHEN THE MOTHER HEARD HOW SHE HAD COME BY HER RICHES SHE WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO SECURE THE SAME LUCK FOR HER OWN IDLE UGLY DAUGHTER
IT GREW IN THE MIDST OF A WONDERFUL GARDEN ALL THE PATHS OF WHICH WERE STREWN WITH PEARLS AS BIG AS PEAS
SO HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND COVERED THEM OVER WITH IT AND HE HIMSELF SAT DOWN UNDER THE TREE
IN THE MEANTIME THE ROE CAME BOUNDING IN AND SISTER TIED THE RUSH CORD ONCE MORE TO ITS COLLAR TOOK THE END IN HER HAND AND SO THEY LEFT THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE FOREST TOGETHER
AT LAST SHE ARRIVES AT THE DOOR
I WOULD RATHER MARRY A GARDENER AND SHE BURST INTO TEARS
HE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD FREED BRYNHILD FROM THE SPELL AND HOW SHE WAS HIS OWN TRUE LOVE AND HOW HE HAD FORGOTTEN AND HAD MARRIED ANOTHER WOMAN AND WON BRYNHILD TO BE THE WIFE OF ANOTHER MAN
AND THERE SPRANG UP ON THE SPOT A BIRCH TREE--A VERY LOVELY BIRCH TREE
AND WHEN YOU MOUNTED THE BEANSTALK YOU CLIMBED THE LADDER OF FORTUNE SHE THEN TOOK HER LEAVE OF JACK AND HIS MOTHER
THE MOMENT THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED THE STONE UNTIED ITSELF
WHEN HE HAD GONE A VERY LITTLE WAY HE MET HIS SERVANT BRINGING HIM THE HORSE FOR THE MASTER THIEF HAD ALREADY TAKEN IT HOME
FATHER HE SAID GRAVELY I HAVE COME TO BID YOU FAREWELL
THE KING WAS DELIGHTED THAT AT LEAST ONE GOOD WORKMAN HAD BEEN FOUND AND GAVE HIM AS MUCH MONEY AS EVER HE WANTED
THE GYPSY HAD OFTEN SEEN THE YOUNG PRINCE PASS BY WITH HIS GUN ON HIS SHOULDER WHEN HE WAS GOING AFTER CROWS
SHE MUST HAVE LOST ONE OF THE BONES
NOW LUCKILY THE PRINCESS'S BED WAS ENTIRELY STUFFED WITH PHOENIX FEATHERS WHICH ARE VERY RARE AND HAVE THE PROPERTY OF ALWAYS FLOATING UPON WATER SO ROSETTE WENT ON SWIMMING ABOUT AS IF SHE HAD BEEN IN A BOAT
SO TO MAKE SURE OF MY KNOWING YOU KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND SAY MY SISTER DEAR OPEN
WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THE YOUTH LET ONE OF THE HARES SLIP OUT OF HIS BAG AND OFF IT SET AND BEGAN TO RUN ROUND THE YARD
THE HEN THAT LAYS GOLDEN EGGS
COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR FOR YOU COME TO ME THEN
EVERY TIME YOU COME TO SEE ME YOU MUST BRING A SKEIN OF SILK WITH YOU AND I WILL MAKE A LADDER OF THEM AND WHEN IT IS FINISHED I WILL CLIMB DOWN BY IT AND YOU WILL TAKE ME AWAY ON YOUR HORSE THEY ARRANGED THAT TILL THE LADDER WAS READY HE WAS TO COME TO HER EVERY EVENING BECAUSE THE OLD WOMAN WAS WITH HER DURING THE DAY
THREE DAYS MORE AND THIS UNHOLY SPELL WOULD HAVE FALLEN FROM ME AND NOW WHO KNOWS HOW LONG I MAY HAVE TO GO ABOUT IN THIS DISGUSTING SHAPE
THE KING LAUGHED AT HIM AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS JOKES BUT MINNIKIN BEGGED HIM JUST TO GIVE HIM WHAT HE HAD ASKED FOR AND THEN HE SHOULD SEE SOMETHING
WAIT A MINUTE HE SAID
FOR THE PRIEST WAS CALLED FATHER LAWRENCE
THEY SHALL HAVE THEIR HEADS CUT OFF AT THE SAME TIME AS THESE STEALERS OF MY DINNER THEN THE OLD MAN WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING AND BEGGED FOR TIME TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING
IT IS IN THE DEPTH OF THE FOREST AND THIS ROAD WILL LEAD YOU THERE
THE YOUNGEST OF THEM WAS CALLED DULLHEAD AND WAS SNEERED AND JEERED AT AND SNUBBED ON EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY
JACK THANKED HER AND SAT DOWN IN THE CHARIOT WITH HER
THE BABY WAS A BOY AND THE KING TOOK HIM AT ONCE AND BROUGHT HIM UP AS HIS OWN SON UNTIL THE LAD GREW UP
THERE WERE NIGHTINGALES CANARIES GOLDFINCHES LINNETS TOMTITS PARROTS OWLS SPARROWS DOVES OSTRICHES BUSTARDS PEACOCKS LARKS PARTRIDGES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU CAN THINK OF
TAKING A KNIFE SHE CHOPPED OFF HER LITTLE FINGER AND PLACING IT ON THE LAST STEP IT STUCK AS THE BONES HAD DONE
INDEED I SHOULD ANSWERED SHE
THE TWELFTH ALONE REMAINED UNOCCUPIED
NOW PLAY ME A LULLABY ROARED THE GIANT
THE FAIRY MADE HER MOUNT BESIDE HER IN THE GOLDEN CHARIOT AND TOOK HER ON BOARD THE ADMIRAL'S SHIP WHERE SHE BADE HER FAREWELL SENDING MANY MESSAGES OF FRIENDSHIP TO THE QUEEN AND BIDDING THE PRINCESS TELL HER THAT SHE WAS THE FIFTH FAIRY WHO HAD ATTENDED THE CHRISTENING
SO AFTER A WHILE HE CAME TO A GREAT HIGHWAY WHICH WAS SO SMOOTH THAT AN EGG MIGHT HAVE BEEN ROLLED ALONG IT WITHOUT BREAKING
THE TREES AND THE BOUGHS AND THE LEAVES AND THE FLOWERS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WAS OF SILVER
THE PRINCE RODE ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND WAVED THE HANDKERCHIEF TWICE ONLY ON THE LEFT HAND
I WAS THINKING WHAT I SHALL CALL MY FIRST CHILD AFTER I AM MARRIED TO THAT YOUNG MAN
ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS WALKING ABOUT AND THINKING OF THIS IT CAME INTO HIS MIND THAT IF HE ONLY HAD HIS BROTHER KING PIPPIN WITH HIM WHO WAS SO LIKE HIMSELF THAT NO ONE COULD DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER HE COULD LET HIM HAVE THE ELDER PRINCESS AND HALF THE KINGDOM
FOR SOME YEARS EVERYTHING WENT WELL WITH THEM AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY IN THEIR NEW HOME
THE KING HAD SO MANY OTHER THINGS TO THINK OF THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE THIS BUT ALL HIS COURTIERS WERE ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH ADMIRING THE PRINCESS AND HER CHARMING PAGE IN GREEN WHO WAS MORE HANDSOME AND DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING THAN ALL THE REST OF THE COURT PUT TOGETHER
OF COURSE I KNOW YOU ARE NOT A PRINCE BUT I SHALL BE JUST AS FOND OF YOU AS IF YOU WERE AND WE CAN GO AND LIVE IN SOME COSY LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD AND BE AS HAPPY AS THE DAYS ARE LONG THE AMBASSADOR THOUGHT HE MUST BE DREAMING AND COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT THE LOVELY PRINCESS SAID
IT WILL BE EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT TWO WEDDINGS TOOK PLACE AND THEY WERE SO MAGNIFICENT THAT THEY WERE HEARD OF AND TALKED ABOUT ALL OVER SEVEN KINGDOMS.(27 27 FROM J
THEN THE MASTER THIEF FLUNG OFF HIS BEGGAR'S RAGS AND TOOK ONE STABLE BOY AFTER THE OTHER AND GENTLY SET HIM ASTRIDE ON THE PARTITIONS WHICH DIVIDED THE STALLS AND THEN HE CALLED HIS ELEVEN MEN WHO WERE WAITING OUTSIDE AND THEY RODE OFF WITH THE GOVERNOR'S HORSES
WELL IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY DRINK COLD WATER AND THINK IT BACON THE UNHAPPY TUBBY ANSWERED CROSSLY
ONLY COME WITH ME AND WE SHALL BE AS HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG TOGETHER BUT SUPPOSE YOU GET TIRED OF ME SAID GRACIOSA
ON THE WEDDING-DAY HOWEVER THE PRINCESS BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE THE LITTLE BOY WHO WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND CARRIED WOOD AND WATER FOR THE KITCHEN-MAID TO FILL THE WINE-CUPS AT THE WEDDING FEAST
BUT WHAT GOD COMMANDS MAN CAN DO
AND THEN BRYNHILD FELL A-WEEPING TILL HER HEART BROKE
MY DEAR ZIZI SAID TUBBY'S SON WE CANNOT PRESENT OURSELVES BEFORE MY FATHER LIKE TWO COMMON PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME BACK FROM A WALK
AND AWAY IT WENT OVER HILL AND DALE AND MOOR AND MORASS AND HALVOR HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO KEEP UP WITH IT
TOWARDS EVENING HE WAS RETURNING HOME WHEN HIS GOOD STEED STUMBLED BENEATH HIM
NONE OF THE GIRLS OF MY OWN COUNTRY ARE BEAUTIFUL IN MY EYES AND THAT IS WHY I CAME TO LOOK FOR A WIFE IN THE LAND OF THE SUN
BUT THE GOURD WAS EMPTY
AND DRAKESTAIL QUITE CONTENT BEGINS TO SWIM SINGING DEAFENINGLY QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK THE KING WAS STILL AT TABLE AND THOUGHT HIMSELF QUITE SURE OF HIS GAME
AS WELL AS THE WAY TO MY OWN HOUSE MADAM
ALL THE PRINCESSES DISAPPEARED DOWN A SECRET STAIRCASE AND MICHAEL HASTILY FOLLOWED THEM
NEXT DAY WHICH WAS A SUNDAY THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO CHURCH THINKING THAT AFTER MASS THEY WOULD AT LAST BE ABLE TO EAT SOME GOOD THING THAT THE RATS HAD NOT TASTED BEFORE THEM
WHY DID I LEAVE HER ALONE
A FIRE WAS BURNING IN THE CASTLE AND HALVOR WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WHICH WAS MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN ANY KITCHEN HE HAD EVER YET BEHELD
BUT THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER SUCKED THE BONES UNDER THE TABLE AND CROUCHING AT THE PEOPLE'S FEET SHE GOT AN EYE KNOCKED OUT POOR THING
BUT HE SPOKE IN VAIN FOR THE MOTHER BEGGED AND PRAYED UNTIL AT LAST HE WENT
YOU NEVER CARED TO GIVE ME A BRUSH
STUMBLING AND KNOCKING HERSELF AGAINST THE FALLEN BRANCHES THEN PICKING HERSELF UP AND GOING ON
THERE HAD BEEN A HARD WINTER AND AFTER IT THE POOR WOMAN HAD SUFFERED FROM FEVER AND AGUE
THE NEW KING AND HIS BROTHER SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
CARRY THE CHILD ABOUT THE WOOD
ANYHOW I'LL EAT THIS LION CUB SAYS HE
IT WOULD NEVER DO BUT SHE SPOKE TO NO PURPOSE FOR THE BOY BEGGED AND PRAYED UNTIL HE HAD GOT SOME OLD RAGS AND A BUNDLE OF PROVISIONS AND THEN HE SET OUT MANFULLY INTO THE WORLD TO FIND HIS TWIN BROTHER
IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD BE MARRIED
WHEN THE KING WHO WAS STILL AT TABLE AND LAUGHING AT THE GOOD TRICK HE HAD PLAYED HIS CREDITOR HEARD HIM AGAIN RECLAIMING HIS MONEY HE BECAME LIVID WITH RAGE
WHILE HE WAS GOING AND LOOKING UP AT EVERY TREE AS HE WENT THE YOUTH LEAPT DOWN AND TOOK HIS OX AND WENT OFF WITH IT
HE KNEW THE WAY TO THE KITCHEN THE DOOR OF WHICH HE FOUND WAS LEFT AJAR
NOW AS HE WAS LONGING TO SEE THE PRINCESSES HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO COME TO A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN BUT THOUGH HE RODE FOR HOURS A RIVER OR FOUNTAIN WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
WHAT AM I TO DO HE ANSWERED
HE ORDERED THEM TO THROW THIS TAIL OF A DRAKE INTO THE WELL TO MAKE AN END OF HIM
YOU SEEM SORROWFUL MY SON SHE SAID
I'LL MAKE A RUSTLING AMONG THE BIRCH LEAVES AND A TREMBLING AMONG THE ASPENS--PERHAPS THE BOY WILL GROW QUIET WHEN HE HEARS IT YES TAKE THE CHILD AWAY TAKE IT TO THE WOOD WITH YOU TO QUIET IT SAID THE PRINCE AND LED THE WIDOW WOMAN INTO THE CASTLE
WHEN NIGHT CAME THE PRINCESS WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT SHE SAID TO FRISK
WHEN SHE WAS IN THE ACT OF WRINGING OUT THE YARN A MAGNIFICENT CARRIAGE PASSED AND THE KING SAT INSIDE
IT IS NOT SO VERY LITTLE AFTER ALL SAID THE BULL
BOTH HER STEP-MOTHER AND HER STEP-SISTER WERE ALWAYS FINDING FAULT WITH HER WHATSOEVER SHE DID AND WHITHERSOEVER SHE WENT AND THEY SCOLDED HER AND ABUSED HER SO THAT SHE NEVER HAD AN HOUR'S PEACE
SO SHE TOOK THE FORM OF THE LADY IN WAITING AND HURRYING INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE QUEEN LAY IN HER BED CALLED OUT THE BATH IS QUITE READY
NO SAID SHE THAT I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT AND THEN SHE WASHED UP AND DID IT VERY TIDILY
IF YOU TOUCH A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BEWARE FOR YOU WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR IT TO ME THEN THE BEASTS WERE FRIGHTENED AND THEY ALL THREE RAN BACK INTO THE WOOD AND THE MUSICIAN PLAYED THE WOODMAN ONE OF HIS BEST TUNES BY WAY OF THANKS AND THEN CONTINUED HIS WAY.(32 32 GRIMM
THUS THE TRUE BRIDE WAS FREED
PERHAPS THIS MAY GIVE SOME CLUE TO THE MYSTERY OF THEIR DISAPPEARANCE HERE THE QUEEN INTERRUPTED HIM SAYING TAKE CARE WHAT YOU SAY SIR
ON THE WAY THEY PASSED A GREAT BOG AND THE PIG ORDERED THE CARRIAGE TO STOP AND GOT OUT AND ROLLED ABOUT IN THE MIRE TILL HE WAS COVERED WITH MUD FROM HEAD TO FOOT
YES I AM SO COLD THAT MY TEETH ARE CHATTERING SAID ANOTHER
HARDLY HAD THEY GOT INTO THE PALACE WHEN THE THUNDER PEALED THE CEILING SPLIT OPEN AND INTO THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE CAME FLYING A FALCON BRIGHT
HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE TURNED THE PIG'S THOUGHTS IN ANOTHER DIRECTION AS HE DID NOT WISH TO GIVE HIM THE PRINCESS FOR A WIFE
I BEFORE I CAME AS A GUEST BUT NOW I HAVE COME AS A WOOER AND HE ASKED FOR THE HAND OF THE PRINCESS OLGA
MOTHER I MOTHER CRIED JACK MAKE HASTE AND GIVE ME THE AXE HIS MOTHER RAN TO HIM WITH A HATCHET IN HER HAND AND JACK WITH ONE TREMENDOUS BLOW CUT THROUGH ALL THE BEANSTALKS EXCEPT ONE
THUS DIED SIGURD FAFNIR'S BANE WHOM NO TEN MEN COULD HAVE SLAIN IN FAIR FIGHT
DO NOT FORGET YOUR USUAL GOOD CUSTOM
BUT THEIR BROTHER WAS NO FOOL
AND AS HE STOOD THUS THE WOLF AND FOX AND LITTLE HARE CAME UP AND THE WOODMAN SAW AT ONCE THAT THEY MEANT MISCHIEF
AND THERE WE MUST LEAVE HIM FOR THE PRESENT AND SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING ELSEWHERE
AND WHEN HE HAD HEARD THESE THINGS HE WENT HIS WAY
NOW MY DEAR WITH YOUR LEAVE I AM GOING UP TO MY ROOM TO FINISH THE STORY I AM READING
I'VE COME THIS ONCE AND NOW FAREWELL THEN THE KING COULD RESTRAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER BUT SPRANG TO HER SIDE AND CRIED YOU CAN BE NO ONE BUT MY DEAR WIFE YES SAID SHE I AM YOUR DEAR WIFE AND IN THE SAME MOMENT SHE WAS RESTORED TO LIFE AND WAS AS FRESH AND WELL AND ROSY AS EVER
SO IF HE EVER CAUGHT ANYONE SMILING HE HAD HIS HEAD CUT OFF THAT VERY MINUTE
SHE WAS NOW IN SUCH TERROR THAT SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND WANTED TO THROW IT AWAY BUT THE BULL SAID THAT SHE WAS TO KEEP IT AND TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF IT AND COMFORTED HER AS WELL AS HE COULD BUT HE BELIEVED THAT IT WOULD BE A HARD STRUGGLE AND HE DOUBTED WHETHER IT WOULD GO WELL WITH HIM
I HAVE FOUND THE SHEEP ALREADY THE MAN THOUGHT THE WITCH WAS REALLY HIS WIFE AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS WIFE WAS THE SHEEP
WHEN THE YOUNGER HAD WALKED FOR SOME TIME HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIS BROTHER A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF HIM AND CALLED TO HIM AND BADE HIM TO STOP
THEN SIGURD WENT DOWN INTO THAT DEEP PLACE AND DUG MANY PITS IN IT AND IN ONE OF THE PITS HE LAY HIDDEN WITH HIS SWORD DRAWN
IN A SHORT TIME IT ASKED AGAIN DO YOU SEE ANYTHING NOW YES
BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS NEAR ITS SETTING THE OUTLANDISH BIRD CAME FLYING UP TO HIM AND AWAKENED HIM SAYING
WHAT WAS THE POOR GIRL TO DO
THE MARES ARE ALL COLLECTED
THEN HE GOT HOLD OF A LONG LADDER SET IT UP AGAINST THE GOVERNOR'S BEDROOM WINDOW AND CLIMBED UP AND MOVED THE DEAD MAN'S HEAD UP AND DOWN JUST AS IF HE WERE SOME ONE WHO WAS STANDING OUTSIDE AND PEEPING IN
DON'T LET US TELL HIM BUT IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BASKET GIVE IT TO ME THE OLD MAN GAVE HER A BASKET AND TYING IT ROUND FRISK'S NECK SHE SAID TO HIM
AND NOW THEY JOURNEYED ON FOR MANY MANY DAYS AND THEN AFTER A LONG LONG TIME THEY CAME TO A SILVER WOOD
SO THEY BADE FAREWELL TO EACH OTHER AND MINNIKIN WENT EAST AND KING PIPPIN WENT WEST
THUS IT HAPPENED THAT SHE CAME TO THE BANK OF THE RIVER AND THERE SHE SAW THE BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HEMLOCK GROWING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE AND WHEN SHE BEGAN TO CUT IT DOWN TO TAKE TO HER GRANDCHILD SHE HEARD A VOICE MOANING
SHE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE WEIGHT OF THE BOX TIRED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE SAT DOWN TO REST IN THE SHADE OF A LITTLE WOOD WHICH LAY ON ONE SIDE OF A GREEN MEADOW
NAY
AFTER THEY HAD GONE A LONG LONG WAY THEY CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE AND WHEN THE GIRL LOOKED INTO IT SHE FOUND IT WAS QUITE EMPTY AND SHE THOUGHT PERHAPS WE MIGHT STAY AND LIVE HERE SO SHE HUNTED UP LEAVES AND MOSS TO MAKE A SOFT BED FOR THE LITTLE ROE AND EVERY MORNING AND EVENING SHE WENT OUT AND GATHERED ROOTS NUTS AND BERRIES FOR HERSELF AND TENDER YOUNG GRASS FOR THE FAWN
BUT I FORESEE THAT YOU WILL MORE THAN ONCE REGRET THAT YOU LEFT THIS FAIRY PALACE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN SO HAPPY BUT IN SPITE OF ALL HE COULD SAY SHE BADE FAREWELL TO THE QUEEN HIS MOTHER AND PREPARED TO SET OUT
FIE SAID MINNIKIN
FIE SAID MINNIKIN
FIE SAID MINNIKIN
AND AS FOR THEM I WILL HAVE THEIR HEADS CUT OFF MEANWHILE THE KING AND THE PRINCE WHO KNEW THAT THEIR SISTER MUST HAVE ARRIVED HAD MADE THEMSELVES SMART AND SAT EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE TO BE SUMMONED TO GREET HER
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER HE HAD GOT DOWN TO THE SEA-SHORE THE TROLL CAME WITH A GREAT WHIZZING AND WHIRRING AND HE WAS MUCH MUCH BIGGER THAN EITHER OF THE TWO FORMER ONES AND HE HAD FIFTEEN HEADS
AT LEAST HE THOUGHT I WILL SOW THE WONDERFUL BEANS
LE VOILA LE PRENEUR DES RATS HE WAS A GREAT GAWKY FELLOW DRY AND BRONZED WITH A CROOKED NOSE A LONG RAT-TAIL MOUSTACHE TWO GREAT YELLOW PIERCING AND MOCKING EYES UNDER A LARGE FELT HAT SET OFF BY A SCARLET COCK'S FEATHER
NO SAID THE KING
AT THIS MOMENT IN CAME THE GAOLER AND WHEN HE MISSED THE LITTLE PRINCESS HE AT ONCE TOLD THE KING WHO CAME IN A GREAT FURY ASKING WHAT THE QUEEN HAD DONE WITH HER
HOWEVER HE BEGGED UNTIL AT LAST HE GOT LEAVE TO GO BUT HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD BE BACK AGAIN IN THE KITCHEN WHEN THE ROAST HAD TO BE TURNED
THERE WERE VESSELS OF GOLD AND SILVER BUT NOT ONE HUMAN BEING WAS TO BE SEEN
BE CALLED PRINCESS SUNBEAM FOR YOU ARE BRIGHT AND CHARMING ENOUGH TO DESERVE THE NAME AND SO SAYING HE DISAPPEARED AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT KNOWING HOW SHE GOT THERE FOUND HERSELF WALKING UNDER SHADY TREES BY A CLEAR RIVER
SO HE WENT ON SHORE AND IT WAS A DELIGHTFUL COUNTRY
SO HE LIKES YELLOW WOMEN
THERE HE SAW A LARGE HILL WITH A DOOR IN IT AND IN HE WENT
BUT SHE HEARD HER HUSBAND COMING AND HID HIM IN THE WARDROBE NOT THINKING THAT IT WAS THE SAME BOY WHO HAD STOLEN THE HEN
WHEN HE HAD BEEN AT HOME FOR SOME DAYS HIS MOTHER WANTED HIM TO GO UP TO THE PALACE TO SHOW THE KING WHAT A GREAT MAN HE HAD BECOME
THEY ARE OBLIGED TO BE FOR I WILL NOT HAVE ANYTHING FORGOTTEN THAT HAPPENS TO YOU HE ANSWERED
THE PRINCESS'S ARMS ACHED WITH TEARING THEM DOWN AND YET SHE WAS NO NEARER TO GETTING OUT AND THE WICKED ENCHANTER BEHIND HER LAUGHED MALICIOUSLY
THE FIRST TIME THE YOUTH RODE AT IT HE GOT A LITTLE WAY UP THE PRECIPICE BUT THEN BOTH DAPPLEGRIM'S FORE LEGS SLIPPED AND DOWN CAME HORSE AND RIDER WITH A SOUND LIKE THUNDER AMONG THE MOUNTAINS
HE GOT READY FOR HIS JOURNEY TOOK LEAVE OF HIS WIFE AND STARTED
THE LITTLE HOOD YOU SEE WAS ONE OF THOSE MAGIC CAPS THAT THEY USED TO HAVE IN FORMER TIMES IN THE STORIES FOR MAKING ONESELF INVISIBLE OR INVULNERABLE
I GATHERED ONE OF THEM AND WHEN I OPENED IT THERE CAME OUT A LOVELY PRINCESS WITH A GOLDEN SKIN
GIVE US SOME OF YOUR FOOD GLADLY SHE SAID AND BREAKING HER CRUST IN TWO SHE GAVE THEM THE HALF
THESE HE PUT AWAY IN AN EMPTY ROOM AND GIVING THE KEY TO HIS WIFE HE BADE HER TELL NO ONE OF IT
BUT DO BE CAREFUL TO KEEP THE LEAF VERY SOON AFTERWARDS THEY CAME TO THE END OF THE WOOD AND THE TROLL WITH THREE HEADS CAME RUSHING UP TO THEM
SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT REMEMBERING HER FATHER'S WORDS SHE TOOK COURAGE DETERMINED TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AS IF IN PRAYER AND CRIED
THE LADY APPEARED TO HIM A SECOND TIME AND SAID
SO THOUGH SHE THOUGHT IT VERY CRUEL SHE SLAVED ON AND CUT AT THE GREAT ANIMAL WITH THE KNIFE TILL SHE HAD CUT OFF HIS HEAD AND HIDE AND THEN SHE FOLDED UP THE HIDE AND LAID IT BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN WALL AND PUT THE COPPER LEAF AND THE SILVER LEAF AND THE GOLDEN APPLE INSIDE IT
WHEN THE COCK CROWED THE THIRD TIME THE FIDDLES STOPPED AND A DELICIOUS SUPPER WAS SERVED BY NEGRO BOYS CONSISTING OF SUGARED ORANGE FLOWERS CRYSTALLISED ROSE LEAVES POWDERED VIOLETS CRACKNELS WAFERS AND OTHER DISHES WHICH ARE AS EVERYONE KNOWS THE FAVOURITE FOOD OF PRINCESSES
NOW WHO DO YOU THINK LIVED THERE
THE SECOND TIME THE PRINCESS CHANGED HERSELF INTO A LOAF AND LAID HERSELF ON THE TABLE AMONG FOUR OTHER LOAVES
TITTY TURNED ROUND AND PERCEIVED THE MISTAKE SHE HAD MADE
SO HE DID THIS
THE CANARY AT ONCE BECAME A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WITH A GOLDEN SKIN WHO JUMPED LIGHTLY TO THE GROUND
HER STEPDAUGHTER OBEYED AS USUAL AND WENT AND BROKE A HOLE IN THE ICE
BUT ALMOST BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE ANOTHER BOY WAS BORN AND HE TOO LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND SAID AH MY DEAR MOTHER
HE STAYED WITH HIS FATHER AND ALL WENT PROSPEROUSLY AND WELL WITH THEM THE WHOLE DAY UNTIL THEY CAME BACK TO LAND IN THE EVENING
I AM REALLY GLAD THAT I AM NOT OFTEN AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS I HAVE BEEN TO-NIGHT THE WICKED NURSE AND THE BOATMAN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME QUITE A LONG WAY OFF HEARD FRISK BARKING AND SAID TO EACH OTHER
AND EVERYWHERE IN THE CEILINGS IN THE FLOORS IN THE CUPBOARDS AT THE DOORS THERE WAS A CHASE AND A RUMMAGE AND SO FURIOUS A NOISE OF GIMLETS PINCERS AND SAWS THAT A DEAF MAN COULD NOT HAVE RESTED FOR ONE HOUR TOGETHER
M
THE FIRST THING I HEARD WAS HIM CALLING FOR HIS PIE
MY LADY QUEEN YOU ARE FAIR TIS TRUE BUT SNOWDROP IS FAIRER FAR THAN YOU
MY LADY QUEEN YOU ARE FAIR TIS TRUE BUT SNOWDROP IS FAIRER FAR THAN YOU
MY LADY QUEEN YOU ARE FAIR TIS TRUE BUT SNOWDROP IS FAIRER FAR THAN YOU
SO THEY SHOOK HANDS AND WENT UP OUT OF THE CELLAR OF TREASURE TOGETHER AND THE DUCHESS LOCKED THE DOOR AND GAVE THE KEY TO THE KING
ONE DAY SOME DROPS OF BLOOD FELL ON HER SPINDLE SO SHE DIPPED IT INTO THE WELL MEANING TO WASH IT BUT AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT IT DROPPED FROM HER HAND AND FELL RIGHT IN
JACK STOLE SOFTLY OUT OF THE WARDROBE AND TAKING UP THE BAGS OF MONEY WHICH WERE HIS VERY OWN BECAUSE THE GIANT HAD STOLEN THEM FROM HIS FATHER HE RAN OFF AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY DESCENDING THE BEANSTALK LAID THE BAGS OF GOLD ON HIS MOTHER'S TABLE
THERE SHE LEFT HER HORSE AND HER FINE CLOTHES AND SAID TO HER MOTHER
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE SHE SAID
WHEN THE PRINCESS WAS ARRAYED IN ALL THE GORGEOUS THINGS THE DWARF HAD BROUGHT SHE WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER AND AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE STREETS THE PEOPLE CRIED
I WILL SAYS HE BUT GOING ON ALL-FOURS YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED
IF YOU NEED THEM I SHALL GIVE YOU FINER ONES SCARCELY WAS SHE IN HER USUAL PLACE BEHIND THE STOVE WHEN HER FATHER CAME HOME WITH THE WITCH
JUST AS HE GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS SITTING THE TROLL CAME RUSHING UP WITH A GREAT WHISTLING AND WHIRRING AND HE WAS SO BIG AND STOUT THAT HE WAS TERRIBLE TO SEE AND HE HAD FIVE HEADS
IN THE MEANTIME THE KING'S SON THREW THE REINDEER SKIN INTO THE FIRE UNOBSERVED
SHE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM TOWN AND WAS CRYING AT NOT FINDING JACK
I THINK I SEE A WAY TO HELP YOU THE QUEEN A LITTLE COMFORTED BY THESE WORDS RECEIVED HER GRACIOUSLY AND BEGGED HER TO TAKE PITY UPON THE POOR LITTLE PRINCESS WHO HAD MET WITH SUCH A SUDDEN REVERSE OF FORTUNE
WHEN HE HAD GOT SAFELY PAST THE CLEFT IN THE ROCK THE YOUNGEST FOAL SAID
THERE ARE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS TO BELIEVE THAN THAT.(16 16 CH
SO THERE WAS THE WOLF WITH HIS THROAT BURNT JUMPING OFF THE BED AND TRYING TO FIND THE DOOR HOWLING AND HOWLING AS IF ALL THE DOGS IN THE COUNTRY WERE AT HIS HEELS
THE PRINCE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER LEAPT TO HIS FEET CROSSED HIMSELF AND WENT STRAIGHT AT THE BEAST
THE TWO GIRLS WERE GREAT FRIENDS AND USED OFTEN TO PLAY TOGETHER
YES THOUGH IT COST ME MY OWN LIFE THEN SHE WENT TO A LITTLE SECRET CHAMBER WHICH NO ONE KNEW OF BUT HERSELF AND THERE SHE MADE A POISONOUS APPLE
ONE DAY THE KING SAID TO HIS WIFE
BUT JUST AS HE REACHED THEIR OWN GARDEN HE BEHELD THE GIANT DESCENDING AFTER HIM
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK THEN TUBBY'S SON SAW HIS FOLLY AND WHILE THE TWO CANARIES FLEW AWAY HE SANK ON THE GROUND WHERE EXHAUSTED BY HIS LAST EFFORT HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS
AND IF BROTHER HAD BUT KEPT HIS NATURAL FORM REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOST DELIGHTFUL KIND OF LIFE
HOWEVER WHEN HE HAD EATEN ALL HE BEGAN TO DRINK HOT LIQUORS IN GREAT ABUNDANCE SO THAT IN A SHORT TIME HE COULD NOT HOLD UP HIS HEAD BUT THREW HIMSELF ON A LARGE CREEL HE HAD MADE FOR THE PURPOSE AND FELL FAST ASLEEP
HAPPY ROSES SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF THEY HAVE ONLY TO BLOSSOM IN THE SUNSHINE AND BE ADMIRED AND THERE IS NOBODY TO BE UNKIND TO THEM AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AND SPLASHED ON TO THE ROSE-TREE ROOTS
TO-MORROW DON'T GO GALLOPING OVER THE MEADOWS BUT DISPERSE AMID THE THICK FORESTS PRINCE IVAN SLEPT ALL NIGHT
FIRST THE ELDEST AND THEN THE SECOND AND SO ON ACCORDING TO THEIR AGE AND HE WAS EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO LAY EACH HEAD AT THE TAIL OF THE FOAL TO WHICH IT HAD BELONGED AND WHEN THAT WAS DONE ALL THE FOALS BECAME PRINCES AGAIN
NO NONE KNEW THIS
I HAVE LOST MY CIRCLET AT THE CASTLE
IT'S ME GRANNY YOUR LITTLE GOLDEN-HOOD
THE WAY WAS LONG AND LAY THROUGH A THICK WOOD WHERE THE PRINCESS HEARD STRANGE VOICES CALLING TO HER FROM EVERY SIDE BUT SHE WAS IN SUCH A HURRY THAT SHE STOPPED FOR NOTHING AND AT LAST SHE CAME TO THE COURTYARD OF THE ENCHANTER'S CASTLE
IF YOU WOULD ONLY CHANGE ME INTO A MOUSE TOO CRIED THE PRINCESS
THIS GOLDEN BRANCH IS INDEED A MARVEL A SINGLE LEAF FROM IT MAKES ONE RICH FOR EVER
THE QUEEN GRIEVED OVER THE SAD FATE OF HER SONS AND REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED SO MUCH SO THAT THE YOUNGEST BOY WHO WAS ALWAYS WITH HER AND WHOM SHE HAD CHRISTENED BENJAMIN SAID TO HER ONE DAY
THEREUPON SHE SENT FOR GRACIOSA WHO TURNED PALE AND TREMBLED AT THE SUMMONS FOR SHE GUESSED THAT IT PROMISED NOTHING AGREEABLE FOR HER
I DID NOT GIVE MUCH FOR HIM AND HE IS NOT WORTH MUCH
A CRYSTAL STREAM RAN THROUGH THE PASTURES
OH I AM ASKING YOU WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE NIGHT-GOWN AND SHEET THAT YOU GOT TO WIPE THE BLOOD OFF YOURSELF WITH SAID SHE
BUT LO AND BEHOLD
AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS OWN HOME AND GOT ALL HIS POSSESSIONS TOGETHER AND TAKING HIS WIFE AND FAMILY HE SET OUT RESOLVED TO GO AND LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY WHERE THE PEOPLE DID NOT DIE BUT WHERE INSTEAD THEY HEARD A VOICE CALLING THEM WHICH THEY FOLLOWED INTO A LAND FROM WHICH THEY NEVER RETURNED
SO THE LAD SAID THAT HE WAS MOST WILLING AND SHE TOLD HIM THAT THREE TROLLS HAD PLANTED THEM ALL THREE THERE IN THE EARTH BUT THAT FORMERLY THEY HAD DWELT IN THE CASTLE WHICH HE COULD SEE AT SOME DISTANCE IN THE WOOD
QUITE TIRED OUT BY SO MANY NEW AND WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN TO REST AT THE FOOT OF A TREE AND THERE SHE FELL FAST ASLEEP
AFTER THIS THEY MET EVERY DAY AS THEY GUARDED THEIR FLOCKS AND WERE SO HAPPY THAT PRINCE PEERLESS BEGGED THE PRINCESS TO MARRY HIM SO THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER BE PARTED AGAIN
WHY DID I NOT FOLLOW THE OLD MAN'S ADVICE
WHEN HE HAD WALKED A LONG WAY HE CAME TO A KING'S PALACE
WE KNOW A FAIR MAID A FAIR MAIDEN SLEEPING
SO THE TROLL STRUCK AT HIM WITH A GREAT THICK IRON BAR WHICH HE HAD IN HIS FIST TILL THE SODS FLEW FIVE YARDS UP INTO THE AIR
EVERY NIGHT I WILL GET UP AND PRAY FOR YOU IN WINTER THAT YOU MAY ALWAYS HAVE A FIRE TO WARM YOURSELVES BY AND IN SUMMER THAT YOU MAY NOT LANGUISH IN THE HEAT THEN SHE BLESSED HER SONS AND THEY SET OUT INTO THE WOOD
HE CRIED ALOUD IF THERE BE A LIVING MAN THERE LET HIM MAKE ANSWER
IN THE MORNING WHEN THE GOVERNOR CAME TO LOOK AFTER HIS STABLE BOYS THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING TO COME TO AGAIN
THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF THIS KING WILL BE MARRIED TO A PIG FROM THE NORTH NOW IF A THUNDERBOLT HAD FALLEN UPON HER FROM HEAVEN IT WOULD NOT HAVE FRIGHTENED HER MORE
BUT OF THE THREE SISTERS THE YOUNGEST LOVED HIM BEST
THIS SHE AGREED TO DO AND THEN THEY SHUT THE BASKET AND LOWERED IT CAREFULLY BABY AND ALL TO THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER
AND DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN ALL SPRUCE AND FRESH STILL SINGING
PRESENTLY THERE CAME FLYING A BIRD--SUCH A BIG ONE THAT THE LIGHT WAS BLOTTED OUT BY IT
BUT THE BEST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO GO AWAY AGAIN FOR IF NOT THE TROLL WILL DEVOUR YOU
WHEN HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE HE MET A MAN WITH A TOLERABLY GOOD HORSE
WHATEVER I GIVE TO YOU I DEPRIVE MYSELF OF
OH WHAT CAN YOU DO THERE SAID THE COOK
SOME DAYS PASSED AND AT LAST HE HAD TO TAKE HIS BRIDE HOME TO THE PALACE AND HE GOT READY TO DO SO
WHEN THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WANTED HIS DINNER THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE POT AND NOTHING IN THE PANTRY
HERE THEY FOUND A NUMBER OF MISERABLE-LOOKING MEN ASSEMBLED
LET US GO AND MEET HER FOR THEY KNEW BY THE UPROAR THAT SHE HAD ARRIVED BUT THEY COULD NOT TELL WHAT ALL THE SHOUTING WAS ABOUT
HE PLACED HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY IN A CORNER ADMIRING THE GRACE AND BEAUTY OF THE PRINCESSES
LADDER LADDER COME OUT OF THY HOLD OR DRAKESTAIL'S DAYS WILL SOON BE TOLD MY FRIEND LADDER WHO WAS ONLY WAITING FOR THESE WORDS HASTENS OUT LEANS HER TWO ARMS ON THE EDGE OF THE WELL THEN DRAKESTAIL CLIMBS NIMBLY ON HER BACK AND HOP
FOR YOU SHALL BE MARRIED THE DAY THAT I AM LAID IN MY GRAVE AND THE COUNT TURNED AWAY WITH A MOCKING LAUGH
THE MAN DID THIS AND NO SOONER HAD HE FLUNG THEM DOWN THAN THEY GREW UP INTO A GREAT THICK WOOD AND FARMER WEATHERBEARD HAD TO GO HOME FOR AN AXE TO CUT HIS WAY THROUGH IT
SHE BROKE OFF A BRANCH OF THE BIRCH TREE STRUCK THE HEARTH WITH IT SO THAT THE SEEDS FLEW INTO THE POT AND THEN HASTENED TO THE CASTLE
THEN THEY SAID TO HER
GOOD HEAVENS
HE LOOKS LIKE A PRINCE SHE SAID
EVERY DAY THEY GREW MORE AND MORE CURIOUS AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT THE END OF THAT WAS
IF YOU DON'T TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM SAYS SHE YOUR BOLD HEAD WILL BE STUCK ON THAT POLE HE DROVE THE MARES AFIELD
THAT NIGHT WHEN HER BABY WAS FAST ASLEEP SHE PACKED IT INTO THE BASKET AND WROTE ON A SLIP OF PAPER THIS UNHAPPY LITTLE GIRL IS CALLED DELICIA THIS SHE PINNED TO ITS ROBE AND THEN VERY SADLY SHE WAS SHUTTING THE BASKET WHEN IN SPRANG THE LITTLE MOUSE AND SAT ON THE BABY'S PILLOW
WHETHER SHE HAS BEEN STOLEN AWAY OR HAS SIMPLY DISAPPEARED I CANNOT TELL
NOW THE KING WAS ASTONISHED TO HEAR SO FINE A SPEECH FROM A PIG AND AT ONCE IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING STRANGE WAS THE MATTER
WHERE THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO THAT DISMAL PART OF THE PALACE WHERE THE KNIGHT KEPT A FURNACE ALWAYS BOILING IN WHICH HE THREW ALL OFFENDERS THAT EVER CAME IN HIS WAY WHICH IN A FEW MOMENTS WOULD ENTIRELY CONSUME THEM
VI MOVED BY PITY FOR HER HUSBAND THE COUNTESS AT LAST FOUND OUT THE CAUSE OF HIS ILLNESS AND ENTREATED HIM TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE CURED
IF THE TROLL CATCHES SIGHT OF YOU HE WILL TAKE YOUR LIFE YOU HAD BETTER TELL ME ABOUT HIM SAID MINNIKIN
THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT EASILY BE DONE
AFTER THE MOTHER OF THE WIND HAD GIVEN THE PRINCESS A CHICKEN TO EAT AND HAD WARNED HER TO TAKE CARE OF THE BONES SHE ADVISED HER TO GO BY THE MILKY WAY WHICH AT NIGHT LIES ACROSS THE SKY AND TO WANDER ON TILL SHE REACHED HER GOAL
WHY THERE IS ENOUGH THERE TO BUY TEN KINGDOMS WELL SAID SHE YOU MUST KNOW THAT ALL THOSE CASKS ARE FULL OF GOLD AND JEWELS AND IF YOU LIKE TO MARRY ME IT SHALL ALL BE YOURS NOW THE KING LOVED MONEY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD SO HE CRIED JOYFULLY
IF HE SUCCEEDED IN THIS HE NO DOUBT KNEW THAT THE KING HAD PROMISED HIS DAUGHTER AND HALF THE KINGDOM TO ANYONE WHO SET HER FREE WHICH PROMISE SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY AND HONOURABLY KEPT BUT IF HE FAILED HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH
MY DEAR DAUGHTER MAYBLOSSOM IS LOST
WHEN SHE QUESTIONED THEM ALL THE EAGLE WAS NOT THERE BUT IT CAME SOON AFTERWARDS AND WHEN ASKED IT SAID THAT IT HAD JUST COME FROM FARMER WEATHERBEARD'S
COME HERE CHILD
BUT THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED WAS THAT AS HE ROWED AWAY HE GOT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FLEET AND BEFORE HE COULD ESCAPE THE ADMIRAL HAD SEEN HIM AND SENT A BOAT AFTER HIM
SO THE MASTER THIEF IMMEDIATELY GOT HOLD OF AN OLD WORN-OUT MARE AND SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO MAKE A COLLAR FOR IT OF GREEN WITHIES AND BRANCHES OF BROOM
AND I WON'T GO AWAY FOR I HAVE DONE NO HARM BUT YOU MUST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT FOR I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY WHEN HALVOR HAD EATEN HIS FILL THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM TO TRY IF HE COULD WIELD THE SWORD WHICH WAS HANGING ON THE WALL BUT HE COULD NOT WIELD IT NOR COULD HE EVEN LIFT IT UP
PRESENTLY SHE WAS TOO TIRED TO ADVANCE ANOTHER STEP SO SHE THREW HERSELF DOWN UPON THE GROUND AND CRIED MISERABLY
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IT SAID
BUT THE REASON MUST BE EXTRAORDINARY AND BEFORE I WANT IT I WILL GIVE YOU ALL YOU DEMAND WELL SAYS THE HEN-WIFE IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE SO STUPID THAT YOU DON'T OBSERVE OR FIND OUT THOSE AFFAIRS THAT ARE SO DANGEROUS AND HURTFUL TO YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILD WHAT IS THAT SAYS THE QUEEN
HALVOR WAS STANDING OUTSIDE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER'S COTTAGE BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
SO HE TIED UP THE THIRD AND RAN AWAY OFF THE ROAD TO LOOK FOR THEM IN THE WOOD
THE CAT CAUGHT IT AND WILL SCRATCH OUT YOUR EYES TOO
NOT LONG AFTER SHE LEARNT THAT GUILBERT HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY
GRACIOSA SET TO WORK AT ONCE BUT BEFORE SHE HAD TAKEN OUT A DOZEN FEATHERS SHE FOUND THAT IT WAS PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW ONE FROM ANOTHER
WHEN YOU GET THERE YOU WILL FIND A WOODEN GOWN WHICH YOU ARE TO PUT ON AND THEN GO TO THE CASTLE AND SAY THAT YOU ARE CALLED KARI WOODENGOWN AND THAT YOU ARE SEEKING A PLACE
DID YOU SEE IF HE HAD ANY MONEY SAID THE ROBBERS
WHEN THE THIRD THURSDAY EVENING CAME EVERYTHING HAPPENED EXACTLY AS IT HAD HAPPENED ON THE TWO FORMER OCCASIONS
SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WOULD DRIVE HIM THERE IN HER CHARIOT WHICH WAS DRAWN BY TWO PEACOCKS
CANST THOU TELL ME THE WAY TO SORIA MORIA CASTLE NO SAID THE MOON THAT I CAN'T FOR WHEN I SHONE THERE THERE WAS A CLOUD BEFORE ME WAIT A LITTLE LONGER SAID THE OLD WOMAN TO HALVOR FOR THE WEST WIND WILL PRESENTLY BE HERE AND HE WILL KNOW IT FOR HE BREATHES GENTLY OR BLOWS INTO EVERY CORNER WHAT
THE GIANT BREAKS HIS NECK
HUF
NOW ATTEND TO THIS
THE STRANGER SENT WORD TO THE COUNSELLORS THAT IF THEY WOULD MAKE IT WORTH HIS WHILE HE WOULD RID THEM OF ALL THEIR RATS BEFORE NIGHT DOWN TO THE VERY LAST
I CAN TALK BECAUSE I WAS A PRINCE SAID THE CRICKET
NO SOONER HAD THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE CRICKET TOUCHED IT THAN THEY WERE RESTORED TO THEIR NATURAL FORMS AND THEIR SURPRISE AND JOY WERE GREAT WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER
DO YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND I QUITE UNDERSTAND REPLIED BLANCHETTE GAILY
WHEN THE ROPE WAS MADE THE PRINCE CALLED FOR HIS BROTHERS AND HE AND THEY HAVING TAKEN SERVANTS WITH THEM AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDED FOR A WHOLE YEAR SET OUT FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE BEAST HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE STONE
I AM CALLED SAID HE THE THIEF OF SLOAN AND SOMETIMES THE BLACK THIEF FROM MY CAP
THERE IS SUCH A DREADFUL WHISTLING UP ABOVE IN THE AIR THAT I THINK I AM GROWING ALARMED SAID THE YOUTH
BUT THEY NEVER HAD THE BLACK THIEF IN THEIR POWER SINCE WELL MY BRAVE FELLOW SAYS THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN I SEE YOU HAVE COME THROUGH MANY DANGERS
SO THE NEXT DAY THE FAIRY APPEARED WITH A HUGE BARREL FULL OF THE FEATHERS OF ALL SORTS OF BIRDS
THEN THE EAGLE TOLD HIM TO PLUCK THREE FEATHERS OUT OF ITS TAIL AND PUT IN THE HARE THE STONE THE SPLINTERS OF WOOD AND HIMSELF INSTEAD OF THEM AND THEN HE WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY THEM ALL HOME
THE ONLY THING YOU WANT IN ORDER TO BECOME AS FAT AS A PIG IS A WIFE THAT CAN BRING YOU BROAD RICH LANDS
WOE IS ME
I CAN REMAIN WITH YOU NO LONGER BUT MUST RETURN TO MY OWN PEOPLE YOUR DESIRE TO GO HOME PLEASES ME SAID MOTHER HOLLE AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE SERVED ME SO FAITHFULLY I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD MYSELF SO SHE TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND LED HER TO AN OPEN DOOR AND AS THE GIRL PASSED THROUGH IT THERE FELL A HEAVY SHOWER OF GOLD ALL OVER HER TILL SHE WAS COVERED WITH IT FROM TOP TO TOE
I MUST TRY AND FIND A PLEASANT COMPANION SO HE TOOK HIS FIDDLE OUT AND FIDDLED TILL HE WOKE THE ECHOES ROUND
IT WAS ONLY THE SCREECH OF THE BARN-OWL THAT ROOSTS IN ONE OF THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING MICHAEL MANAGED TO SLIP IN FRONT AND RUNNING UP THE STAIRCASE HE REACHED THE PRINCESSES ROOM FIRST
BUT SHE WAS SO UGLY THAT NOTHING COULD MAKE HER LOOK NICE AND WHAT WAS WORSE SHE WAS SULKY AND ILL-TEMPERED AND DID NOTHING BUT GRUMBLE ALL THE TIME
THEN IT WAS THE KING'S TURN TO LOOK SAD AND AT LAST HE SAID
THEN HE JERKED AWAY AT THE ROPE AND HIS BROTHERS BEGAN TO HAUL IT UP
HE WALKED STRAIGHT IN BETWEEN THE LIONS JUST AS IF HE DID NOT SEE THEM AND THEN INTO THE SMALL CHAMBER AND LAY DOWN ON THE BED
THEY TOOK A BOAT AND PUT OUT TO SEA CARRYING WITH THEM THE BUSHEL OF GOLD PIECES AND ENOUGH DRESSES TO LAST THE PRINCESS TEN YEARS IF SHE WORE TWO EVERY DAY AND THEY DID NOTHING BUT LAUGH AND SING
THIS TIME THE DAPPLED HORSE WAS NOT UNWILLING TO GO AWAY WITH THE YOUTH SO HE MOUNTED IT AND WHEN HE CAME RIDING HOME TO HIS BROTHERS THEY ALL SMOTE THEIR HANDS TOGETHER AND CROSSED THEMSELVES FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY EITHER SEEN OR HEARD TELL OF SUCH A HORSE AS THAT
OH IT SLEEPS SOUNDLY NEVER FEAR THEN THE DUCK ASSUMED THE QUEEN'S SHAPE WENT UP TO THE CHILD'S ROOM TUCKED HIM UP COMFORTABLY IN HIS CRADLE AND THEN SWAM BACK DOWN THE GUTTER AGAIN IN THE LIKENESS OF A DUCK
MDME
HER FINGERS SEEMED TO STICK FAST TO THE GOOSE AND SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER HAND AWAY
NOW SAID THE MERCHANTS OF BREMEN THESE GERMANS CANNOT BE OTHER THAN THE DESCENDANTS OF THE LOST CHILDREN OF HAMEL THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL DID NOT DOUBT IT
IN THE FIRST WINDOW THERE WAS A PICTURE OF HIM IN ONE OF THE TURRETS OF THE TOWER FARTHER ON HE WAS SEEKING SOMETHING IN A CHINK IN THE WALL IN THE NEXT PICTURE HE WAS OPENING AN OLD CABINET WITH A GOLDEN KEY AND SO IT WENT ON THROUGH NUMBERS OF SCENES AND PRESENTLY THE PRINCE NOTICED THAT ANOTHER FIGURE OCCUPIED THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACE IN EACH SCENE AND THIS TIME IT WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
SO THAT INSTEAD OF THE THREE DAYS THAT HAD TO RUN BEFORE THE SPELL WAS BROKEN I WAS FORCED TO REMAIN A PIG FOR THREE MORE YEARS
PERCINET AT FIRST OFFERED TO SEND HIS COURIER TO FIND OUT BUT THE PRINCESS SAID
NOW I'LL COMB YOUR HAIR PROPERLY FOR YOU FOR ONCE IN THE WAY POOR SNOWDROP THOUGHT NO EVIL BUT HARDLY HAD THE COMB TOUCHED HER HAIR THAN THE POISON WORKED AND SHE FELL DOWN UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN THEY HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE THEY GOT UPON THE ICE AND THERE THEY MET A MAN IN A CARRIAGE WHO WAS DRIVING A BLACK HORSE
AND AS HE HAD RECEIVED AT HIS BIRTH THE NAME OF DESIRE THEY ALL CALLED HIM D'AMOUR DESIRE
IS MY ROE WELL
IS MY ROE WELL
IS MY ROE WELL
I DECLARE MY STOMACH FEELS QUITE EMPTY AND I MUST DRAW MY BELT TIGHT IF I'M NOT TO DIE OF STARVATION DULLHEAD WAS DELIGHTED AND SAID
WAIT FOR ME HERE AND IN AN HOUR I WILL RETURN WITH CARRIAGES AND HORSES FIT FOR A PRINCESS DON'T BE LONG REPLIED ZIZI AND SHE WATCHED HIM GO WITH WISTFUL EYES
IT IS NOTHING SAID LINA
HOW DEALS THE LORD WITH YOU OUT CAME RUNNING THE PRINCESS MARYA JOYFULLY GREETED HER BROTHER IVAN AND BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HIS HEALTH AND TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT HERSELF
YOU WILL SEE IT AGAIN BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN BURIED NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME SAID GRACIOSA IN HER MOST COAXING VOICE THOUGH AFTER ALL I AM MORE TO BE PITIED THAN YOU ARE WHEN THEY GOT NEAR THE PALACE THE PRINCE MADE THE SLEDGE AND THEMSELVES INVISIBLE SO THE PRINCESS GOT IN UNOBSERVED AND RAN UP TO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE KING WAS SITTING ALL BY HIMSELF
WHEN I SHALL HAVE FOUND THREE PEOPLE SILLIER THAN YOU I WILL COME BACK AND MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER SO HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY AND AFTER WALKING A LONG WAY HE REACHED AN ORCHARD
MOTHER SAYS THAT THEY ARE JUST COMMON SCARLET-RUNNERS AND NOTHING ELSE
THE YOUTH SNATCHED UP HIS GUN AND RAN TO THE LAKE
THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA CARRIED HIM OFF INTO HER OWN REALM
THEY NEVER SUSPECTED THE TERRIBLE SURPRISE THAT AWAITED THEM ON THEIR RETURN HOME
BUT THE QUEEN WAS SO VAIN THAT SHE THOUGHT ALL THEIR ADMIRING GLANCES WERE FOR HERSELF ESPECIALLY AS IN SPITE OF THE BADNESS OF THEIR CAUSE THE KING'S KNIGHTS WERE SO BRAVE THAT THEY WERE THE VICTORS IN EVERY COMBAT
SO HE TOOK THE YOUNGEST FOR HIS QUEEN AND LIVED WITH HER VERY HAPPILY FOR A LONG TIME
COME IN MY YOUNG FRIEND SAID THE OLD MAN
SO THE LADY RESOLVED TO GO WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE TO PRAY FOR MERCY FROM THE SPINNER AND IN THE NAME OF RENELDE'S DEAD MOTHER SHE BESOUGHT HER TO SPIN NO MORE
THE LITTLE GOOD MOUSE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO LOVED EACH OTHER SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE NEVER HAPPY UNLESS THEY WERE TOGETHER
HIS COAT WAS NEARLY HIDDEN UNDER AN EMBROIDERY OF PEARLS AND DIAMONDS HIS BOOTS WERE SOLID GOLD AND FROM HIS HELMET FLOATED SCARLET PLUMES
THEN SHE TOLD THEM HOW HER STEPMOTHER HAD WISHED HER PUT TO DEATH AND HOW THE HUNTSMAN HAD SPARED HER LIFE AND HOW SHE HAD RUN THE WHOLE DAY TILL SHE HAD COME TO THEIR LITTLE HOUSE
CERTAINLY WE QUITE AGREE TO THAT SAID THE BROTHERS IN ONE BREATH
MINNIKIN STOLE IT BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE
AT LENGTH I CAME TO A LARGE CASTLE AND FATIGUE OBLIGED ME TO CALL IN THE SAME WHERE I FOUND A YOUNG WOMAN AND A CHILD SITTING ON HER KNEE AND SHE CRYING
BUT HE REPLIED I LIKE THAT
DRAKESTAIL DRAKESTAIL WAS VERY LITTLE THAT IS WHY HE WAS CALLED DRAKESTAIL
NOT LONG AFTER THE CLERK CAME THAT WAY AND WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE THE PARSON FOLLOWING THE FOOTSTEPS OF THREE GIRLS
HERE COMES A HARE SAID THE MUSICIAN
THE LADDER WAS COMPLETE AND WITH HER CHILD ON HER ARM SHE ENTERED THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
LET HIM DO WHAT HE MIGHT WITH ROD AND LINE THERE WAS NEVER EVEN SO MUCH AS A SPRAT ON HIS HOOK
I ASSURE YOU THE PRINCESS IS QUITE WELL AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY
AS TO THE QUEEN SHE WAS SO DISAPPOINTED THAT IN SPITE OF FINDING A BETTER DINNER THAN USUAL AND SEEING THE LITTLE MOUSE DANCING IN ITS MERRIEST MOOD SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT CRY
I WILL HAVE A BIT OF THIS BREAD FOR MYSELF SAID HE
ROBBERS AND RABBLE OF THAT SORT SAID THE OLD WOMAN
ONE SHALL BE YOUR BRIDAL SHIFT AND THE OTHER SHALL BE MY SHROUD
NOW NO ONE KNEW ANY MORE THAN BEFORE ABOUT THE GOOD MAN'S DAUGHTER NO ONE KNEW WHENCE SHE CAME
SEE IF I DON'T MAKE HER CHANGE HER MIND PRETTY SOON SAID THE WICKED KING WITH A CHUCKLE
BUT WHEN HE HAD TOLD HER WHO HE WAS IN HER GREAT JOY SHE FORGOT ALL HER SUFFERINGS AND THEY SEEMED AS NOTHING TO HER
HOWEVER WHEN NEARLY ALL THE STRANGERS HAD BEEN DEFEATED A YOUNG UNKNOWN KNIGHT PRESENTED HIMSELF
THERE THEY LIVED A LONG TIME TOGETHER AND THE YOUNG WIFE BORE A SON TO THE PRINCE
THEY SWOOPED DOWNWARDS AND AS SOON AS THEY TOUCHED THE GROUND THEY TURNED INTO HER TWELVE BROTHERS AND SHE KNEW THAT SHE HAD FREED THEM
LITTLE SIMPLETON YOU SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING HEART CAN DESIRE NO INDEED
BUT THIS DID NOT LAST LONG FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE KING'S COURT BECAME ENVIOUS OF THE LAD AND THERE WAS NO BAD THING THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE TO HIM IF THEY HAD BUT DARED
THE KING ASKED WHERE HE HAD COME FROM BUT THE BOY SAID HE DID NOT KNOW NOR YET COULD HE TELL THEM HOW HE HAD GOT THERE BUT HE BEGGED VERY EARNESTLY AND PRETTILY FOR A PLACE IN THE KING'S PALACE
WELL SAID SHE AS I AM UNABLE TO FIND YOU YOU MUST SHOW YOURSELF
WASH ME GIRL IT SAID
THE WALLS WERE OF TURQUOISES AND UPON A LOW COUCH LAY A LOVELY LADY WHO SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP
OH POOR OLD CREATURE SAID MINNIKIN YOU SHALL HAVE A TASTE OF THE WORT TOO LIKE THE REST SO HE WENT AWAY AND SCOOPED UP A LITTLE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BREWING VAT IN A MILK PAN AND GAVE IT TO HER AND THEN HE WAS QUIT OF THE WHOLE OF THEM
SO HE MANAGED TO GET ACROSS THE FIERY RIVER AND THEN WENT ON TO THE BABA YAGA'S
NOTHING SHOULD MAKE ME MARRY YOU
THE SECOND DAUGHTER OF THIS KING WILL MARRY A PRINCE FROM THE WEST THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED AND LAUGHED AND TEASED EACH OTHER
CHOOSE A HORSE FOR YOURSELF SAID THE KING
AND AS SOON AS THE WICKED PRINCE WAS GONE SHE TOOK THE FORM OF AN OLD PEASANT WOMAN AND SAID TO HER
THEY HAD CAUSED THE PRINCESS'S PORTRAIT TO BE PAINTED AND SENT TO ALL THE NEIGHBOURING COURTS FOR IN FOUR DAYS SHE WOULD HAVE COMPLETED HER TWENTIETH YEAR AND IT WAS TIME TO DECIDE WHOM SHE SHOULD MARRY
THEN THROUGH THE EAST DOOR OF THE TOWN CAME THREE LITTLE BOYS WHO CRIED AND WEPT AND THIS IS WHAT THEY TOLD
HER FACE WAS AS BROAD AS A FULL MOON AND HER MOUTH WAS SO LARGE THAT EVERYBODY WHO MET HER WOULD HAVE BEEN AFRAID THEY WERE GOING TO BE EATEN UP ONLY SHE HAD NO TEETH
VERY WELL SAID HE I'LL WAIT TILL WE COME TO THE NEXT SPRING WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SECOND BROOK SISTER HEARD IT REPEATING TOO
LET HIM GO IN PEACE IRON GATE IRON GATE CRIED THE VOICE GROWLING LIKE THUNDER FALL ON HIM AND GRIND HIM TO POWDER NO REPLIED THE GATE
WILL YOU TAKE US AND THE BOATMAN ANSWERED
FROM THIS HE PASSED ON THROUGH NUMBERS OF SPLENDID ROOMS UNTIL AT LAST HE REACHED ONE ALL HUNG WITH BLUE GAUZE
THE QUEEN SENT FOR GRACIOSA AND SAID TO HER
IN THE MEANWHILE THE PEOPLE HAD FOUND THEIR KING AND HIS MINISTERS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE AIR ON THE PAVEMENT AND THEY HAD GONE INTO THE PALACE TO KNOW HOW IT HAD OCCURRED
BUT THE ADMIRAL COCKED-HAT INTERRUPTED HER CRYING
WHEN THEY HAD SAILED FOR SOME TIME LONGER THE BROTHER ONCE MORE POINTED OVER THE SEA
AT LENGTH A RICH BISHOP DIED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I WAS THEN IN AND I HEARD HE WAS INTERRED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF JEWELS AND RICH ROBES UPON HIM ALL WHICH I INTENDED IN A SHORT TIME TO BE MASTER OF
THE PRINCE WILLING TO GRATIFY HIS REQUEST TOLD HIM THEIR AFFAIRS FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
AND HOW MANY WERE THEY NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE WELL RECKONED WELL RECKONED THEN GO AND JOIN THEM OLD SIRE AND AU REVOIR THEN THE OLD WHITE RAT SPRANG IN HIS TURN INTO THE RIVER SWAM TO THE WHIRLPOOL AND DISAPPEARED
SO HE SET A BARREL FULL OF RED-HOT NAILS UNDER HIS HORSE'S NOSE AND A TROUGH FILLED WITH OATS BENEATH ITS TAIL AND THEN HE TIED THE HALTER FAST TO A HOOK AND WENT AWAY INTO THE INN
DO THEY PROPOSE THAT I SHALL MARRY THIS HIDEOUS CREATURE
BUT HIS PARENTS WERE SO AMAZED AT THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS APPAREL THAT THEIR WONDER NEVER CEASED
THE MOTHER OF THE MOON WHEN SHE SAW HER SAD PLIGHT FELT A GREAT PITY FOR HER AND TOOK HER IN AND NURSED AND TENDED HER
BUT WHAT WILL I DO IN REGARD OF THE PIE CUT A FINGER OFF IT SAID I AND I WILL BRING YOU IN A YOUNG WILD PIG OUT OF THE FOREST WHICH YOU MAY DRESS AS IF IT WAS THE CHILD AND PUT THE FINGER IN A CERTAIN PLACE THAT IF THE GIANT DOUBTS ANYTHING ABOUT IT YOU MAY KNOW WHERE TO TURN IT OVER AT THE FIRST AND WHEN HE SEES IT HE WILL BE FULLY SATISFIED THAT THE PIE IS MADE OF THE CHILD SHE AGREED TO THE SCHEME I PROPOSED AND CUTTING OFF THE CHILD'S FINGER BY HER DIRECTION I SOON HAD IT AT THE HOUSE SHE TOLD ME OF AND BROUGHT HER THE LITTLE PIG IN THE PLACE OF IT
HE SNEAKED AWAY TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH HER HOWEVER FOR HE WAS ASHAMED TO HOLD THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES AT THE PALACE WITH SO STRANGE A BRIDE
SO NOW GO AND MAKE YOURSELF FIT TO BE SEEN AS I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO VISIT HER SO THE PRINCESS WENT VERY SORROWFULLY TO HER OWN ROOM AND HER NURSE SEEING HER TEARS ASKED WHAT WAS VEXING HER
SO HE CAREFULLY OBEYED THE ORDERS HE HAD BEEN GIVEN BY THE LADY
WHITHERSOEVER HE WENT THERE WERE WIDE PLAINS WITH FIELDS AND MEADOWS BUT AS FOR PEOPLE THERE WERE NONE TO BE SEEN
BUT FIRST OF ALL THOU MUST MAKE THE SUN SHINE INTO MY PALACE HERE FOR THERE WAS A LARGE AND HIGH HILL OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS WHICH OVERSHADOWED THE PALACE SO MUCH THAT THE SUN COULD NOT SHINE IN
AFTER THE BANQUET CAME A BALL AND AFTER THAT AGAIN A BALLET AND AT LAST THEY WERE ALL SO TIRED THAT EVERYONE FELL ASLEEP JUST WHERE HE SAT
JUST AS IF I SHOULD DIRTY MY HANDS FOR YOU AND ON SHE WENT
HALVOR GOT BEHIND THE DOOR
THE PRINCESS OBEYED IN SILENCE AND THE DUCHESS WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER OR THANKING HER SCRAMBLED UP UPON THE BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHERE SHE SAT LOOKING LIKE A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES AND EIGHT OFFICERS HAD TO HOLD HER UP FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD FALL OFF
SO COME HERE BOTH OF YOU AND LET ME CROWN YOU AND WE WILL HAVE THE WEDDING AT ONCE THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS THANKED HER WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HER THEY OWED ALL THEIR HAPPINESS AND THEN THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD SO LATELY BEEN MICE CAME AND BEGGED THAT THE FAIRY WOULD USE HER POWER TO RELEASE THEIR UNHAPPY FRIENDS WHO WERE STILL UNDER THE ENCHANTER'S SPELL
THE POOR WOMAN NEARLY DIED OF THESE HARDSHIPS BUT SHE KEPT A BRAVE HEART AND AT LENGTH SHE REACHED AN ENORMOUS CAVE IN THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN
WHAT IS THE MATTER ALAS
ONLY I WARN YOU THAT IF SHE IS NOT AS PRETTY AS YOU HAVE TOLD ME I WILL HAVE YOUR HEADS CUT OFF OH
I BROUGHT YOU HERE TO TELL ME IF THE CHILD WILL GROW UP PRETTY AND FORTUNATE THEN THE FAIRY ANSWERED THAT THE PRINCESS WOULD BE AS PRETTY AND CLEVER AND WELL BROUGHT UP AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE AND THE OLD KING GROWLED TO THE QUEEN THAT IT WAS LUCKY FOR HER THAT IT WAS SO AS THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HANGED IF IT WERE OTHERWISE
GO YOU MUST WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
WELL THE MAN WAS AMAZED WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE PEOPLE WERE STUPID ENOUGH TO FOLLOW THE VOICE THOUGH THEY KNEW THAT IF THEY WENT WHEN IT CALLED THEM THEY WOULD NEVER RETURN
BUT WHEN THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH OVER A HEAD ROSE UP OUT OF THE WATER AND SAID
X NOT FAR FROM THE FOUNTAIN THERE LIVED A FAMILY OF BRICKLAYERS
BUT THE GOVERNOR AGAIN PUT HIM OFF WITH FINE WORDS AND ONLY GAVE HIM THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS SAYING THAT HE MUST DO ONE MORE MASTERPIECE OF SKILL AND IF HE WERE BUT ABLE TO DO THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HER
HO
WHEN THE MAN HEARD THAT HE WAS RIGHT GLAD FOR HE FANCIED HE RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS BIG BULLOCK AND THOUGHT THAT NOW HE SHOULD FIND BOTH OF THEM AGAIN
THEN HE CLIMBED UP THE TREE HIMSELF LIFTED HER DOWN PUT HER ON HIS HORSE AND BORE HER HOME TO HIS PALACE
EVERY TIME SHE SPEAKS A TOAD SHALL JUMP OUT OF HER MOUTH AND THE THIRD
I AM WAITING FOR MY LOVER ZIZI REPLIED
BUT THE GUARDS FELL ASLEEP THE BONDS LOOSED THEMSELVES AND THE SPINNER SPUN ON
AND SHE FELT SO ANGRY THAT SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO BE REVENGED AT ONCE
I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE A NAP BY-AND-BY THEN HE TOOK UP THE BROWN HEN AND SAID TO HER
SO THE YOUTH RODE ONWARDS AGAIN AND MANY AND MANY WERE THE NEW SCENES THEY SAW FOR TRAVELLING ON DAPPLEGRIM'S BACK WAS NOT TRAVELLING SLOWLY AS MAY BE IMAGINED AND THEN DAPPLEGRIM NEIGHED
LEANING ON HER PARTNER'S SHOULDER SHE SWEPT BY LIKE A WHIRLWIND
SO THE YOUTH PRODUCED THE BOTTLE OF WATER AND THE BIT OF MOSS WHICH HE HAD GOT FROM THE OLD WOMAN SAYING
HOWEVER SHE COMPLAINED THAT THE HEAPS OF FEATHERS WERE BADLY ARRANGED AND FOR THAT THE PRINCESS WAS BEATEN AND SENT BACK TO HER GARRET
YES THIS TIME HE SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOKED BLACK FAR FAR AWAY AND WAS RATHER LIKE A CHURCH TOWER
AH DELICIA
PLAY AND THE HARP PLAYED A VERY SOFT SAD AIR
THE MOON
HE LET HIMSELF SLIDE TO THE EARTH AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HIS HORSE HIS THROAT BURNING HIS CHEST HEAVING AND HIS HEAD GOING ROUND
TAKING THE BRANCH HE TOUCHED HER LIGHTLY WITH IT SAYING
THEN THE YOUTH SPRANG DOWN FROM THE TREE RAN BY A SHORT CUT AND GOT BEFORE HIM AND ONCE MORE HUNG HIMSELF UP ON A TREE IN THE ROAD BEFORE THE MAN
AND INDEED NO NOISE WAS EVER HEARD IN THE ROOM YET THE SHOES COULD NOT WEAR THEMSELVES OUT ALONE
HE TRAVELLED ONE DAY HE TRAVELLED TWO DAYS
AND THE PRINCES AFTER HAVING SECURELY FASTENED THEIR BARQUES GAVE THEIR ARMS TO THE PRINCESSES AND CONDUCTED THEM TO THE CASTLE
HE WHO DELIVERED MY DAUGHTER MUST HAVE SOME TOKEN IN PROOF OF IT SO RITTER RED RAN OFF AT ONCE FOR HIS HANDKERCHIEF WITH THE LUNGS AND TONGUE AND MINNIKIN WENT AND BROUGHT ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS THINGS WHICH HE HAD TAKEN OUT OF THE TROLLS SHIPS
BUT WHEN THEY SAT DOWN TO THE MARRIAGE-FEAST THE BRIDEGROOM AROSE AND WENT DOWN TO THE STABLE FOR HE SAID THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN SOMETHING WHICH HE MUST GO AND LOOK TO
ALREADY HE FELT THAT DEATH WAS NEAR HIM WHEN HIS EYES FELL ON THE BAG WHERE THE ORANGES PEEPED OUT
I WANT TO MAKE MY PIG EAT SOME ACORNS AND I CAN'T GET HIM TO GO UP THE TREE IF YOU WERE TO CLIMB UP AND SHAKE DOWN THE ACORNS THE PIG WOULD PICK THEM UP OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT HERE IS THE SECOND IDIOT SAID THE LOVER TO HIMSELF
THE STEP-MOTHER FELL INTO SUCH A TOWERING PASSION THAT SHE DROVE THE MAN'S DAUGHTER INTO THE PIG-STYE--SHE MIGHT STAY THERE WITH HER FINE SHOW OF GOLD THE STEP-MOTHER SAID BUT SHE SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO SET FOOT IN THE HOUSE
SAID HE
AS THE GIRL NEVER CAME BACK THE MOTHER WENT DOWN TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER AND FOUND HER SITTING ON THE STAIRS HER HEAD IN HER HANDS WHILE BY HER SIDE THE BEER WAS RUNNING ALL OVER THE FLOOR AS SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO CLOSE THE TAP
AT THE SIGHT OF THE HIDEOUS GYPSY HE WAS STRUCK DUMB WITH SURPRISE AND HORROR
IF IT'S AS YOU SAY YOU MAY TAKE AS MUCH RAMPION AWAY WITH YOU AS YOU LIKE BUT ON ONE CONDITION ONLY--THAT YOU GIVE ME THE CHILD YOUR WIFE WILL SHORTLY BRING INTO THE WORLD
A SINGLE BUCKET OF WATER WILL NOT QUENCH MY THIRST
THE CHARIOTS MET WITH A FRIGHTFUL CRASH IN MID-AIR AND THE PRINCESS LOOKED ON IN BREATHLESS ANXIETY WHILE A FURIOUS BATTLE TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE LOVELY FAIRY WITH HER GOLDEN LANCE AND THE HIDEOUS LITTLE DWARF AND HER RUSTY PIKE
LOOK IN THE TRUNK OF THAT TREE AND YOU WILL FIND A HONEYCOMB BUT DON'T BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SHARE IT WITH FANFARONADE MAYBLOSSOM RAN TO THE TREE AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS THE HONEY
THEN THERE APPEARED NOT A WOLF BUT A CREATURE QUITE AS WICKED AND QUITE AS UGLY
LET US GO HOME SISTERS HE CRIED
NO THANK YOU I WILL TRY MYSELF SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE WENT AWAY TO THE FIREPLACE AND PUT SOME ASHES ON THE RING
SHE DOES THROW HIM A GOOD MORSEL OR TWO NOW AND THEN
BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE PALACE HAD AGAIN STIRRED UP THE KING AND HE ANSWERED THAT THE YOUTH SHOULD HAVE HER AND THAT HE HAD NEVER INTENDED THAT HE SHOULD NOT
BUT WHEN THEY ASK YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-DAY WHOM YOU WILL HAVE TO BE YOUR CUP-BEARER YOU MUST SAY I WILL HAVE THE RAGGED BOY WHO IS IN THE KITCHEN AND CARRIES WOOD AND WATER FOR THE KITCHEN-MAID AND WHEN I AM FILLING YOUR CUPS FOR YOU I WILL SPILL A DROP UPON HIS PLATE BUT NONE UPON YOURS AND THEN HE WILL BE ANGRY AND STRIKE ME AND THIS WILL TAKE PLACE THRICE
BUT THEY WERE SO FRIENDLY AND ASKED HER WHAT HER NAME WAS IN SUCH A KIND WAY THAT SHE REPLIED
SEEING THAT THE CLOTH WAS NO FARTHER ADVANCED THAN IT WAS THE EVENING BEFORE HE INQUIRED THE REASON
AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN THE BASKET WAS FINISHED THE QUEEN WAS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW TO SEE HOW LONG A CORD SHE MUST MAKE TO LOWER IT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TOWER WHEN SHE NOTICED A LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO WAS LEANING UPON HER STICK AND LOOKING UP AT HER
PRESENTLY SHE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE WHOLE BUSH RUSTLING AND SHAKING AND A SOFT LITTLE VOICE FROM THE PRETTIEST ROSEBUD SAID
SO THE KING HAD A TOWER BUILT ON PURPOSE
AND HE SET TWO MEN TO WATCH HIS BUSHY BRIDE
THAT MAY BE SAID THE BULL
THAT MAY BE SAID THE BULL
IF YOU LIKE I WILL HELP YOU OH
WHAT SAID SHE THIS ROGUE KNOWS OUR SECRET AND YOU NEVER TOLD ME
SO THE WEDDING WAS HELD AT ONCE WITH SO MUCH SPLENDOUR AND REJOICING THAT ALL THE PREVIOUS MISFORTUNES WERE QUITE FORGOTTEN.(1 1 LA PRINCESSE PRINTANIERE
I'M SO THIRSTY SISTER
SHE SENT FOR HER AND WITH THE SAME THREATS AS BEFORE LOCKED HER UP WITH THE THREE KEYS ORDERING THAT ALL THE FEATHERS SHOULD BE SORTED BY SUNSET
NOW DEAR GO AND LIE DOWN AND REST SO THAT YOUR WOUND MAY HEAL THE WOUND WAS REALLY SO SLIGHT THAT IT WAS QUITE WELL NEXT DAY AND THE LITTLE ROE DID NOT FEEL IT AT ALL
WHAT PREVENTS YOUR MARRYING HIM ASKED THE ELDEST YOU WOULD BECOME A GARDENER TOO
WHEN HER HUSBAND THE PIG CAME BACK TO HIS HOUSE HE WAS STARTLED BY WHAT HE SAW
THEY SANG AND DANCED AND ATE SUGAR-PLUMS AND WERE THE GAYEST OF THE GAY AND ALL THEIR SUBJECTS FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE SO THAT THE KINGDOM WAS CALLED THE JOYOUS LAND
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS SAID SHE SMILING
THE CLATTER IT MADE UPON THE FLOOR ATTRACTED THE PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK'S ATTENTION
CAN YOU HIDE YOURSELF HERE IN THE CUPBOARD
THEN SIGURD IN THE SHAPE OF GUNNAR AND IN HIS MAIL MOUNTED ON GRANI AND GRANI LEAPED THE FENCE OF FIRE AND SIGURD WENT IN AND FOUND BRYNHILD BUT HE DID NOT REMEMBER HER YET BECAUSE OF THE FORGETFUL MEDICINE IN THE CUP OF THE WITCH'S WINE
I WILL HELP YOU
BUT AS SHE WENT HER RING CAUGHT ON THE LATCH OF THE DOOR FOR THE KING'S SON HAD HAD IT SMEARED WITH TAR
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE HE IS HERE AND THEN HE ASKED THEM THE WAY TO SORIA MORIA CASTLE
SHE FOUND THE TURKEY-MAIDEN SITTING UPON A BIG STONE BAREFOOTED AND MISERABLY DRESSED IN AN OLD COARSE LINEN GOWN AND CAP
THERE CAME FLYING BIRDS FROM EVERY PART OF THE WORLD AND ALL BUT PECKED OUR EYES OUT WELL WELL
RAPUNZEL RAPUNZEL LET DOWN YOUR GOLDEN HAIR THEN RAPUNZEL LET DOWN HER PLAITS AND THE WITCH CLIMBED UP BY THEM
ONE DAY THE WOMAN TURNED TO THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SAID
WHEN HE REACHED THEM OF COURSE HE RECOGNISED THE PRINCESS AND HE WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND KISSED HER HAND QUITE JOYFULLY
HE WENT TO BED SHAKING WITH FEVER
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN LYING HERE ALL DAY INSTEAD OF WATCHING THE FOALS SO WHEN THEY CAME SHE GAVE THE LAD A BOTTLE OF WATER AND A BIT OF MOSS AND TOLD HIM TO SHOW THESE TO THE KING AND SAY THAT THIS WAS WHAT HIS SEVEN FOALS ATE AND DRANK
LET HIM GO IN PEACE DOG MY GOOD DOG CRIED THE VOICE MORE AND MORE ANGRY JUMP AT HIS THROAT AND EAT HIM UP NO REPLIED THE DOG
WELL WELL SAID THE MAN THEN YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOAN OF A PAIR OF SNOW SHOES OF MINE
YOU WON'T HAVE TO SERVE A YEAR WITH ME BUT JUST THREE DAYS
OUT FELL THE BROKEN STONE AND WITH IT THE GOLDEN KEY
WHEN SHE REACHED THE CHURCH SHE WAS SO PRETTY AND SO SPLENDIDLY DRESSED THAT EVERY ONE WONDERED WHO SHE COULD BE AND HARDLY ANYONE LISTENED TO WHAT THE PRIEST WAS SAYING FOR THEY WERE ALL LOOKING FAR TOO MUCH AT HER AND THE PRINCE HIMSELF LIKED HER SO WELL THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF HER FOR AN INSTANT
MINNIKIN HOWEVER TOOK HOME WITH HIM AN ARMFUL OF GOLD AND SILVER HOOPS FROM THE TROLL'S SHIP
MICHAEL BEHAVED MOST RESPECTFULLY
AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR WHAT A VOICE IT HAS SO THEY TRAVELLED ON THROUGH MANY MORE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COUNTRY AND THEN DAPPLEGRIM NEIGHED FOR THE THIRD TIME
WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK TO THE PALACE SOME ONE TOLD THE KING WHO SAID
SO AT COCK-CROW NEXT MORNING WHEN THE PEOPLE CAME TO KILL THE BULL HE WAS GONE AND WHEN THE KING GOT UP AND ASKED FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS GONE TOO
AT LAST HE CAME ACROSS AN OUTLANDISH BIRD AND ITS YOUNG ONES
WE WILL LOOK AT IT AND REMEMBER YOU THE PRINCE HANDED OVER HIS SILVER SNUFF-BOX TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT HIS WAY
BUT I WILL TRY TO FIND SOME WAY OF DOING IT
NOW BEGIN THE OTHER THE SPINNER SET TO WORK
AGAIN THERE AROSE A STORM-CLOUD WITH WHIRLWIND AND LIGHTNING
AGAIN THERE AROSE A STORM-CLOUD WITH WHIRLWIND AND LIGHTNING
BREATHE UPON THE WHITE SIDE AND YOUR LOOKS WILL NOT ALTER BUT YOU WILL GROW BETTER AND HAPPIER DAY BY DAY
THE OTHER STABLE-BOYS HAD HEARD HIM DOING THIS SO THEY PEEPED THROUGH THE KEY-HOLE INTO HIS ROOM AND SAW THAT HE WAS KNEELING THERE BEFORE A PICTURE
GOOD-MORNING MY FINE COOK GOOD-MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE COOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AND AT THE MOMENT THAT THE CANARY WAS BEGINNING I PRAY HEAVEN THAT IT MAY SEND A SCULLION WHO WAS HIDDEN OUTSIDE RUSHED OUT AND SHUT THE SHUTTERS
IF YOU WILL ONLY COME SAID THE COUNT TO HER WHEN NEXT HE RODE BY I WILL SEND AWAY THE COUNTESS AND WILL MARRY YOU BUT TWO YEARS BEFORE WHEN RENELDE'S MOTHER WAS DYING OF A LONG ILLNESS THE COUNTESS HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THEM BUT HAD GIVEN HELP WHEN THEY SORELY NEEDED IT
THE OLD MAN SAW THAT ROSETTE MUST BE SOME GREAT LADY FOR HER BED COVERINGS WERE ALL OF SATIN AND GOLD
HERE HE HAD BUILT HIMSELF A SORT OF HOUSE BY PLACING TRUNKS OF TREES TOGETHER AND FASTENING THEM WITH WITHES AND HERE HE LIVED ALONE SHUNNING HUMAN KIND
WHAT DO YOU SAY
THE TWO OTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND MOCKED HIM
NEVERTHELESS SHE CHOSE A THIRD TIME BUT WITH NO BETTER FORTUNE FOR THE NURSE MOVING QUICKLY RAN INTO THE BRANCH OF A TREE AND BLINDED HERSELF WITH A THORN
PRINCE CURLICUE WAS DELIGHTED
WHEN THE MAN GOT THERE AND FOUND THAT HIS OX WAS GONE HE BEGAN TO WEEP AND WAIL FOR HE WAS AFRAID THAT WHEN HIS OLD WOMAN GOT TO KNOW SHE WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
IF YOU DO NOT GET THIS SORTED AND ALL THE SEED BACK INTO THE POT I SHALL KILL YOU THE GIRL WEPT BITTERLY
NOW THEN PRAY TO GOD AND LIE DOWN TO SLEEP
WHAT IS YOUR NAME MY NAME IS FRIEND WOLF
YOUR FATHER HAS SENT YOU HERE TO MARRY MY SON HE SAID AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT I AM NOT GOING TO OFFEND HIM BY ALTERING HIS ARRANGEMENTS SO THE POOR PRINCESS WAS SENT AWAY IN DISGRACE TO HER OWN APARTMENTS AND THE LADIES WHO ATTENDED UPON HER WERE CHARGED TO BRING HER TO A BETTER MIND
WELL FATHER DEAR SAID SHE FOR SHE THOUGHT IT WAS HER HUSBAND
RAPUNZEL RAPUNZEL LET DOWN YOUR GOLDEN HAIR FOR RAPUNZEL HAD WONDERFUL LONG HAIR AND IT WAS AS FINE AS SPUN GOLD
NEGLECT NOT TO GIVE THEM EDUCATION SUITABLE TO THEIR BIRTH AND LET THEM BE TRAINED UP TO EVERY EXERCISE AND PASTIME REQUISITE FOR KING'S SONS TO LEARN
THE ROBBERS ALSO WERE NOT VERY WELL PLEASED AT THIS FOR THEY WERE FORCED TO OWN THAT THE YOUTH WAS AT THE HEAD OF THEM ALL
BUT RENELDE WHO WAS BETROTHED TO A YOUNG WOOD-CUTTER CALLED GUILBERT HAD NO INTENTION OF OBEYING THE COUNT AND SHE HAD BESIDES TO TAKE CARE OF HER GRANDMOTHER
WHEN THE SERMON WAS OVER AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE CHURCH THE PRINCE HAD CAUSED A FIRKIN OF TAR TO BE EMPTIED OUT IN THE PORCH IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT GO TO HELP HER OVER IT
NEVERTHELESS RETURN TO THE CASTLE AND ACT AS YOU WILL FIND NEEDFUL JACK ASKED THE FAIRY IF SHE WOULD SHOW HIM THE WAY TO THE CASTLE AS THE BEANSTALK WAS NOW DOWN
THE PRINCESS SENT TO EACH OF THE FAIRIES A NEW SPINNING-WHEEL WITH A DISTAFF OF CEDAR WOOD AND THE QUEEN SAID SHE MUST LOOK THROUGH HER TREASURES AND FIND SOMETHING VERY CHARMING TO SEND THEM ALSO
IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT THE GIGANTIC BEANSTALK AND ONLY STUPIDLY WONDERED ABOUT IT SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE LEFT YOU WHERE MISFORTUNE HAD PLACED YOU ONLY RESTORING HER COW TO YOUR MOTHER
NOW AS SOON AS THE PRINCE HAD GOT RID OF THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER HE GREETED THE CINDER WENCH AS HIS BRIDE AND THEY WANDERED TOGETHER TO THE BIRCH TREE WHICH GREW UPON THE MOTHER'S GRAVE
THE KING IS DEAD LONG LIVE THE KING
WHEN DULLHEAD HEARD THIS HE MARCHED BEFORE THE PRINCESS WITH HIS GOOSE AND ITS APPENDAGES AND AS SOON AS SHE SAW THESE SEVEN PEOPLE CONTINUALLY RUNNING AFTER EACH OTHER SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING AND COULD NOT STOP HERSELF
I AM THIRSTY
IN THE MEANTIME THE GOOD BLANCHETTE WENT QUIETLY ON HER WAY AS LITTLE GIRLS DO AMUSING HERSELF HERE AND THERE BY PICKING EASTER DAISIES WATCHING THE LITTLE BIRDS MAKING THEIR NESTS AND RUNNING AFTER THE BUTTERFLIES WHICH FLUTTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
OUT OF EACH ORANGE WILL COME A PRINCESS AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH YOU LIKE FOR YOUR WIFE
IT WAS EASY TO GUESS THAT THEY HAD COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THEY SAW PEACOCKS IN EVERY TREE AND THEIR CRIES COULD BE HEARD A LONG WAY OFF
IN THE GREATEST TERROR SHE RAN UP AGAIN TO THE QUEEN CRYING
SO OFF HE WENT WITH THE SHEET AND THE NIGHT-GOWN TOO
THIS IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY SO FAREWELL THE KING HAD SCARCE TIME WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES TO ASSURE HER SHE SHOULD BE OBEYED IN EVERYTHING WHEN SHE TURNING HERSELF IN HER BED WITH A SMILE GAVE UP THE GHOST
GRACIOSA FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE WAS HOPELESSLY LOST SURELY NOT EVEN PERCINET COULD FIND HER IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH
BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HER TEARS AND GROANS DID HER NO GOOD SHE GOT UP DETERMINED TO GO WHEREVER FATE SHOULD LEAD HER
BUT THEN A BETTER IDEA CAME TO HIM AND HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A DOVE SO THAT NO WITCHCRAFT COULD HAVE POWER OVER HIM AND FLEW INTO THE ROOM WITHOUT TOUCHING THE LADDER
I'LL GET A BIT OF HONEYCOMB SAYS HE
THE WITCH WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE HANDED TO THE CINDER WENCH
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING NOW
HE COULD NOT GET OVER IT
ONLY THE LOVERS WERE AS WIDE-AWAKE AS MICE AND THE PRINCESS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR SAID TO FANFARONADE
HE KNOCKED AT THE STABLE DOOR AND IT OPENED AT ONCE
HOWEVER SHE ENTERTAINED THE FAIRIES SPLENDIDLY AND GAVE THEM BEAUTIFUL RIBBONS OF WHICH THEY ARE VERY FOND IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER PRESENTS
AND HE BADE HER KEEP THE BROKEN PIECES OF THE SWORD TO MAKE A NEW SWORD FOR HIS SON AND THAT BLADE SHOULD BE CALLED GRAM
THEN HE HANDED TO HER AN OLD COPPER MILK-CAN AND SAID
THEY TOLD THAT THEY IN CROSSING HUNGARY HAD SOJOURNED IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY CALLED TRANSYLVANIA WHERE THE INHABITANTS ONLY SPOKE GERMAN WHILE ALL AROUND THEM NOTHING WAS SPOKEN BUT HUNGARIAN
TAKE COURAGE PRINCESS
AS SHE TURNED INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE CASTLE THE KING'S SON CAME OUT TO MEET HER TIED HER STEED TO A PILLAR AND LED HER IN
I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE FAITHFUL AND CAPABLE OF FEELING A REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR ME FOR YOU SEE WE FAIRIES ARE RICH IN EVERYTHING BUT FRIENDS AND THOSE ARE HARD TO FIND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SHOULD WANT FOR FRIENDS YOU CHARMING CREATURE SAID THE QUEEN KISSING HER
THERE'S THE MASTER THIEF MOTHER SAID THE GOVERNOR NUDGING HIS WIFE
NOUS N'IRONS PLUS AU BOIS LES LAURIERS SONT COUPES AND DANCING IN SUMMER BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
WHO'S BEEN DRINKING OUT OF MY LITTLE TUMBLER THEN THE FIRST DWARF LOOKED ROUND AND SAW A LITTLE HOLLOW IN HIS BED AND HE ASKED AGAIN
SO ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN SITTING CRYING AND SORROWING THE BULL CAME UP TO HER AND ASKED WHY SHE WAS ALWAYS SO FULL OF CARE
PERCEIVING HE STILL RETAINED THE FIGURE OF A MORTAL MAN I BEGAN TO IMAGINE THAT IT COULD NOT BE THE BISHOP'S GHOST
JACK WONDERED VERY MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF OR SEEN THIS CASTLE BEFORE
NOW HE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO MAKE HASTE AND THROW YOURSELF OVERBOARD ANSWERED THE STEP-MOTHER
GIVE ME THAT RAZOR AND I'LL TEACH HIM TO LET PEOPLE ALONE FOR THE FUTURE AND HE RUSHED OUT OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WERE RUNNING AFTER SOME ONE WHOM NO ONE ELSE SAW
YES YES SAID THE KING
THEN SHE PRESENTED HIM TO THE FAIRY AND TOLD HIM HOW CARABOSSE HAD BEEN FINALLY ROUTED AND HE THANKED AND CONGRATULATED THE FAIRY WHO WAS MOST GRACIOUS TO HIM
THEY STOLE ME AWAY WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND I HAVE HAD TO KEEP HOUSE FOR THEM EVER SINCE I STILL THINK I WILL GO TO BED ALL THE SAME SAID THE YOUTH
THE THIRD TIME IT WAS JUST BEGINNING TO GROW LIGHT AND THEN SHE SAID
WAS IT NOT NECESSARY THAT HIS BODY AS WELL AS HIS SHROUD SHOULD BE READY FOR THE BURIAL
THE OLD WOMAN WAS STANDING RAKING THE FIRE AND SHE WAS DOING IT WITH HER NOSE SO LONG IT WAS
THAT MAY BE SAID THE BULL AND RUSHED AT THE TROLL AND GORED OUT HIS EYES AND DROVE HIS HORNS RIGHT THROUGH HIM SO THAT HIS ENTRAILS GUSHED OUT BUT THE TROLL FOUGHT JUST AS WELL AS HE DID AND IT WAS THREE WHOLE DAYS BEFORE THE BULL GOT THE LIFE OUT OF HIM
I WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH HER LIBERTY OF CHOICE THE PRINCESS OLGA GAVE HER CONSENT AND MARRIED THE EAGLE
IT WOULD BE AMUSING TO SEE HIM SO THE KING'S DAUGHTER TOLD MINNIKIN THAT THE TROLL WAS OUT TRYING TO GET HOLD OF SOMEONE WHO COULD BREW A HUNDRED LASTS OF MALT AT ONE BREWING FOR THERE WAS TO BE A FEAST AT THE TROLL'S AT WHICH LESS THAN THAT WOULD NOT BE DRUNK
AS FOR HER SHE SAID TO HERSELF
I CANNOT EXPLAIN MORE AT PRESENT
WHEN ONCE THEY HAVE TAKEN MY LIFE THEY WILL SOON KILL YOU ALSO SAID THE BULL
DEAR LITTLE ONE I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL BE RICHER THAN YOUR FATHER AND SHALL LIVE A HUNDRED YEARS ALWAYS PRETTY AND HAPPY WITHOUT FEAR OF OLD AGE AND WRINKLES THE QUEEN QUITE DELIGHTED THANKED THE FAIRY GRATEFULLY AND BEGGED HER TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE DELICIA AND BRING HER UP AS HER OWN DAUGHTER
BUT THEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING WITH ONE SHOE IF HE HAD NOT THE FELLOW TO IT SO HE JOURNEYED ONWARDS AND LET IT LIE WHERE IT WAS
HE IS ALWAYS WITH ME IN A MOMENT OH
YOU MAY CALL AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WILL NEVER GET ME TO COME AND HE GOT SO ANGRY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE WAS ACTUALLY STANDING AT THE DOOR TORMENTING HIM
IT WAS THE KING OF THE BAND
NO CHILDREN ANYWHERE THEY HAD ALL DISAPPEARED
MICHAEL GATHERED IT AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A MOMENT CLOTHED IN VELVET WHICH WAS AS BLACK AS THE EYES OF THE LITTLE PRINCESS WITH A CAP TO MATCH A DIAMOND AIGRETTE AND A BLOSSOM OF THE ROSE LAUREL IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE
XV AT LAST THE ELDEST SISTER MADE A SIGN AND ONE OF THE BLACK PAGES BROUGHT IN A LARGE GOLDEN CUP
THAT WAS NO PART OF OUR BARGAIN ANSWERED THE YOUTH
HE HAD LOST TWO YEARS OF HAPPINESS BUT COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THINKING THAT HIS WIFE WAS A CLEVER SPINNER AND WHAT WAS MUCH MORE RARE A BRAVE AND GOOD WOMAN.(24 24 CH
IT IS THE HEAT REPLIED THE PRINCESS
HE LED HER DOWN TO THE STRAND BUT WHEN THE TIME DREW NEAR FOR THE TROLL TO COME HE CLIMBED UP INTO THE TREE AGAIN AND HID HIMSELF
A GOOD BED GOOD FOOD AND TUNS FULL OF BEER
HE FOUND NOTHING
SISTERS SAID THE ELDEST PRINCESS ALL DAY LONG WE SEW SPIN AND READ
RENELDE CONFESSED THAT THE COUNTESS HAD PRAYED HER NOT TO LET HER HUSBAND DIE
I'VE NOT THE SMALLEST DESIRE FOR HIS COMPANY HOW BEAUTIFULLY YOU PLAY DEAR MR FIDDLER SAID THE LITTLE HARE
WHEN IT WAS WELL SCALDED SHE HUNG IT ROUND THE POOR GIRL'S SHOULDER AND GIVING HER AN AXE SHE BADE HER BREAK A HOLE IN THE FROZEN RIVER AND RINSE THE YARN IN IT
THAT BEAST WHICH THOU WISHEST TO OVERCOME IS MY BROTHER
GRACIOSA WAS SO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND PERCINET AND TO HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE GLOOMY FOREST AND ALL ITS TERRORS THAT SHE WAS VERY HUNGRY AND VERY MERRY AND THEY WERE A GAY PARTY
ONE DAY HE WAS OUT FISHING BUT CAUGHT NOTHING AT ALL
HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD TIED UP HIS HORSE AND WENT INDOORS
THEN THE THREE LITTLE MEN CONSULTED WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TO HER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO BAD AND HAD SUCH AN EVIL COVETOUS HEART THAT SHE GRUDGED EVERYBODY THEIR GOOD FORTUNE
NOW THE GOOD-NATURED DESIRE WAS AS SOFT-HEARTED AS HE WAS BRAVE
SHE HAD NOT TIME TO LOOK FOR IT BUT SPRANG TO THE SADDLE AND RODE LIKE AN ARROW TO THE BIRCH TREE
NOW THEN LOOK ALIVE CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS
A FEW YARDS FURTHER HE SAW A HUGE OVEN WITH A WIDE RED-HOT GAPING MOUTH
HUNGRY AND FAINT HE WANDERED ON WALKED FARTHER AND FARTHER AND AT LAST CAME TO WHERE STOOD THE HOUSE OF THE BABA YAGA
THEN THEY CLIMBED UP HIGHER AND THE FELL GREW MORE LEVEL SO THAT THEY COULD SEE FARTHER AROUND THEM
HE TOO MET THE LITTLE OLD GREY MAN WHO BEGGED HIM FOR A MORSEL OF CAKE AND A DRAUGHT OF WINE
LOOK HERE
WHEN GRACIOSA LOOKED AT HIM HE WENT DOWN ON ONE KNEE AND SAID TO HER
KING GRUMPY WAS SO CONVINCED THAT PRINCE CURLICUE WOULD SOON GET TIRED OF BEING IN PRISON AND SO CONSENT TO MARRY THE PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK THAT HE SENT AMBASSADORS TO HER FATHER PROPOSING THAT SHE SHOULD COME AND BE MARRIED TO HIS SON WHO WOULD MAKE HER PERFECTLY HAPPY
I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN THE WORLD INDEED SHE IS REALLY A HUNDRED TIMES AS PRETTY AS THAT SAID HER BROTHERS
SNOWDROP WHO DWELLS WITH THE SEVEN LITTLE MEN IS AS FAIR AS YOU AS FAIR AGAIN WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THESE WORDS SHE WAS NEARLY STRUCK DUMB WITH HORROR FOR THE MIRROR ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND SHE KNEW NOW THAT THE HUNTSMAN MUST HAVE DECEIVED HER AND THAT SNOWDROP WAS STILL ALIVE
THE WIDOW SAW THAT THERE WAS NO MEANS OF KEEPING JACK AND HERSELF FROM STARVATION BUT BY SELLING HER COW
NO HELP WAS NEAR SO SHE CRIED AT LAST IN HER ANGUISH
WHO DRINKS OF ME WILL BE A ROE
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THEY COULD APPLY TO THE BRIDE HERSELF
IF YOU CAN DO THAT I WILL DO MY BEST FOR YOU SAID THE GOVERNOR
AT THIS MOMENT FLORIMOND AND THE FAIRY DOUCELINE APPEARED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR AND THE FAIRY AS SHE DESCENDED FROM HER CHARIOT SAID WITH A SMILE
MY CHILD THE WORDS AND WHOLE BEHAVIOUR OF THIS PIG ARE QUITE UNLIKE THOSE OF OTHER PIGS
SHE TIED A WOODEN BEETLE ON WHERE HER CHILD'S FOOT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOG OF WOOD INSTEAD OF AN ARM AND STUCK A BIT OF DIRT IN THE EMPTY SOCKET FOR AN EYE AND TOOK THE CHILD WITH HER TO THE CASTLE
SO FOR TWO DAYS THEY FLOATED UP AND DOWN THE SEA WET AND SHIVERING WITH THE COLD AND SO HUNGRY THAT WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW SOME OYSTERS SHE CAUGHT THEM AND SHE AND FRISK BOTH ATE SOME THOUGH THEY DIDN'T LIKE THEM AT ALL
EVERY DAY SHE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LONG GALLERY UNTIL SHE TOO WAS ATTRACTED AND FASCINATED BY THE EVER-CHANGING PICTURES IN THE WINDOWS AND RECOGNISED HERSELF IN ONE OF THE FIGURES
NO 34 KARI WOODENGOWN THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A KING WHO HAD BECOME A WIDOWER
AND NOW MY DEAR SHE SAID I AM GOING FOR A WALK IF YOU DON'T WANT ME ANY LONGER GO SAID THE GIANT
THE KING IS DINING AND WILL NOT BE DISTURBED TELL HIM THAT IT IS I AND I HAVE COME HE WELL KNOWS WHY THE PORTER SHUTS HIS WICKET AND GOES UP TO SAY IT TO THE KING WHO WAS JUST SITTING DOWN TO DINNER WITH A NAPKIN ROUND HIS NECK AND ALL HIS MINISTERS
IF THAT'S ALL SAID THE KING AND HE SENT TO ALL THE SHOE-MAKERS IN HIS KINGDOM AND THEY VERY SOON MADE THE QUEEN TEN THOUSAND GREEN SATIN SLIPPERS BUT STILL SHE LOOKED SAD
WITH ALL MY HEART REPLIED THE KING AND I WILL MAKE HER VERY HAPPY
WHEN THE DWARFS HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY SAID
HE COUNTED ON HIS SWEETHEART MY FRIEND RIVER
THE PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN SAW THIS TOO AND BELIEVED THAT IT WAS STILL THE SAME HARE THAT WAS RUNNING ABOUT SO THEY WANTED TO GO OUT AND CATCH IT
LET ME HAVE HIM FOR BREAKFAST YOU ARE GROWN OLD AND STUPID CRIED THE LADY IN HER LOUD TONES
I HAVE A SPLENDID HEROIC STEED NOW
WELL SAID THE NORTH WIND YOU CAN EASILY GO A LITTLE QUICKER THAN I CAN FOR I HAVE TO PUFF AND BLOW INTO EVERY CORNER
BUT HOW IN THE WORLD IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE SUN TO BE ANGRY
IN THE MORNING WHEN HE WENT TO THE SEA-SHORE THE PRINCESSES WERE OUT OF THE EARTH AS FAR AS THEIR WAISTS
THEN THEY PUT THE COFFIN ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND ONE OF THE DWARFS ALWAYS REMAINED BESIDE IT AND KEPT WATCH OVER IT
SO SHE HANDED OVER ALL THE HOUSE-KEEPING AFFAIRS TO PRINCE IVAN AND GAVE HIM THESE INSTRUCTIONS
AND FIRST OF ALL THE LITTLE GIRL WAS CALLED AND IS STILL CALLED LITTLE GOLDEN-HOOD
THE PRINCE CROSSED HIMSELF WENT UP TO IT AND SMOTE IT ON THE HEAD WITH HIS SWORD
SO FORTH THEY RODE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE FOR BRYNHILD HAD QUITE GONE OUT OF SIGURD'S MIND BY REASON OF THE WITCH'S WINE BUT SHE REMEMBERED HIM AND LOVED HIM STILL
BUT TWO OF HER TEARS TOUCHED HIS EYES AND IN A MOMENT THEY BECAME QUITE CLEAR AGAIN AND HE SAW AS WELL AS HE HAD EVER DONE
THE DAUGHTER WAS LED INTO THE FOREST WHERE THE WILD BEASTS TORE HER TO PIECES AND THE OLD WITCH WAS BURNT AT THE STAKE
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW SAID THE BULL
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW SAID THE BULL
BY-AND-BY THE GIANT PUT THE HEN DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND SOON AFTER WENT FAST ASLEEP SNORING SO LOUD THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE THUNDER
HERE HE WAS SEIZED WITH DREADFUL THIRST
GO INTO THE TOWN AND FIND OUT THE BEST KITCHEN AND BRING ME ALL THE NICEST MORSELS THAT ARE BEING ROASTED UPON THE SPIT FRISK DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND AS HE KNEW OF NO BETTER KITCHEN THAN THE KING'S HE WENT IN SOFTLY AND WHEN THE COOK'S BACK WAS TURNED TOOK EVERYTHING THAT WAS UPON THE SPIT AS IT HAPPENED IT WAS ALL DONE TO A TURN AND LOOKED SO GOOD THAT IT MADE HIM HUNGRY ONLY TO SEE IT
BUT NO SOONER HAD HE GOT INTO THE BOAT THAN IT BEGAN TO MOVE OFF WITH HIM SO QUICKLY THAT THE WATER FOAMED ALL ROUND ABOUT AND ALL THAT THE LAD DID TO KEEP THE BOAT BACK WITH THE OARS WAS DONE TO NO PURPOSE FOR IT WENT ON AND ON THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH AND AT LAST HE CAME TO A WHITE STRAND THAT LAY FAR FAR AWAY
AFTER SUPPER THE DANCERS ALL WENT BACK TO THEIR BOATS AND THIS TIME THE STAR GAZER ENTERED THAT OF THE ELDEST PRINCESS
IF THAT CHILD IS TO HAVE A BETTER HORSE THAN MINE I WILL GO BACK TO MY OWN CASTLE THIS VERY MINUTE
XVI THE MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE A FEW DAYS LATER
IF HE HAS A FEW CLOTHES TO HIS BACK THAT IS ALL THEN THE ROBBERS BEGAN TO MUTTER TO EACH OTHER APART ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WITH HIM WHETHER THEY SHOULD MURDER HIM OR WHAT ELSE THEY SHOULD DO
BUT I FORBID YOU ON PAIN OF DEATH TO LOOK AT WHAT IT CONTAINS GRACIOSA SET OUT WEARING HER LITTLE CAP AND WOODEN SHOES AND THE OLD COTTON FROCK BUT EVEN IN THIS DISGUISE SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT ALL THE PASSERS-BY WONDERED WHO SHE COULD BE
BEFORE NIGHT SAID HE I SHALL HAVE DESPATCHED ALL THE RATS IN HAMEL IF YOU WILL BUT PAY ME A GROS A HEAD A GROS A HEAD CRIED THE CITIZENS BUT THAT WILL COME TO MILLIONS OF FLORINS THE TOWN COUNSELLOR SIMPLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID TO THE STRANGER
I MUST GO IN SEARCH OF MY WIFE THE FAIR PRINCESS MARYA MOREVNA HARD WILL IT BE FOR YOU TO FIND HER ANSWERED THE FALCON
THE GIRL WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE WOOD AND AS BEFORE THE THREE LITTLE MEN WERE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW
YOU JUST GO YOUR OWN WAY AND HE LEFT THE LITTLE MAN STANDING THERE AND WENT FURTHER ON INTO THE FOREST
THEN HE TOOK OUT THE ROLL OF TOBACCO TOOK A WHIFF AND GAVE THE OLD WOMAN SOME SNUFF ON THE BACK OF HER HAND
NOW SAID THE MUSICIAN IF YOU WANT TO LEARN TO FIDDLE HERE'S YOUR CHANCE
HOW PRETTY SHE IS
THEN HER HUSBAND GREW ALARMED AND SAID
BUT THE WEDDING FEAST WAS ALL PREPARED AS REGARDED BREWING AND BAKING AND ALL THE WEDDING GUESTS WERE SITTING WAITING SO UGLY AS SHE WAS THE KING WAS FORCED TO TAKE HER
THEY SENT FOR THE STAR GAZER AND ASKED HIM HOW HE HAD CONTRIVED TO LEARN THEIR SECRET
NOW YOU ARE MINE SAID HE TO THE PRINCESS
WITHOUT HESITATING THE RATS TOOK THE LEAP SWAM STRAIGHT TO THE FUNNEL PLUNGED IN HEAD FOREMOST AND DISAPPEARED
YES ONE AND ALL THEY SLUMBER DEEP THEN THE DUCK WENT ON
THOU HAST NO CLOTHES BUT THOSE RAGS THOU ART GOING ABOUT IN HALVOR STILL BEGGED FOR LEAVE AND AT LAST GOT IT BUT HE WAS TO COME BACK AT ONCE IF THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANYONE LAUGH CERTAINLY
A GROS A HEAD
MY WIFE SAW YOUR RAMPION FROM HER WINDOW AND CONCEIVED SUCH A DESIRE FOR IT THAT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DIED IF HER WISH HAD NOT BEEN GRATIFIED THEN THE WITCH'S ANGER WAS A LITTLE APPEASED AND SHE SAID
AT NOON CAME THE PRIEST AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAD TOLD HIM OF THE TRICK PLAYED BY THE MASTER THIEF THERE WAS NO END TO THE RIDICULE HE CAST ON THE GOVERNOR
BEFORE THE PRINCE HAD TIME TO LOOK ROUND THEY WERE ALL OUT OF SIGHT
SOME TIME OR OTHER I'LL DO YOU A GOOD TURN HE WENT ON FARTHER AND SAW A HIVE OF BEES IN THE FOREST
SO HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD THREE SONS WHO HAD GONE AWAY ONE DAY AND HOW HE HAD GIVEN THEM PERMISSION TO GO WHERE THEY CHOSE AND TAKE TO WHATSOEVER WORK THEY FANCIED
THE KING HAVING ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED A PORTRAIT OF THIS PRINCESS HAD IT PLACED IN HIS GREAT HALL UNDER A CANOPY AND SENT FOR PRINCE CURLICUE TO WHOM HE SAID THAT AS THIS WAS THE PORTRAIT OF HIS FUTURE BRIDE HE HOPED THE PRINCE FOUND IT CHARMING
NO SAID THE MAN THAT HAVE I NOT HARK YOU SAID THE GOVERNOR
THIS THEY DID BUT NO SOONER HAD THEY WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE THAN THEY MET AGAIN
BUT HE WAS BRAVE AND HE SPOKE NOT A WORD OF IT TO THE OTHERS TO MAKE THEM UNHAPPY
SIR AMBASSADOR I AM SURE THAT EVERYTHING YOU INTEND TO SAY IS CHARMING SINCE IT IS YOU WHO MEAN TO SAY IT
THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED WITH MUCH POMP AND CEREMONY BUT THE BRIDE NEITHER SPOKE NOR LAUGHED
BUT HOW THEY DID AFTER THE OLD KING'S DEATH IS NOT KNOWN.(4 4 THE HIBERNIAN TALES
NOW THE BROTHER WHO WAS IN SERVICE IN THE KING'S PALACE HAD TAKEN A PORTRAIT OF HIS SISTER AND HE HAD CARRIED THE PICTURE AWAY WITH HIM AND EVERY MORNING AND EVENING HE KNELT DOWN BEFORE IT AND PRAYED FOR HIS SISTER SO DEARLY DID HE LOVE HER
SO WHEN HE HAD WALKED THE WHOLE DAY HE TOO CAME TO THE KING'S PALACE AS DARKNESS BEGAN TO FALL
AND SO WILL HE TOO NO YOU NEVER WERE SAID THE KNIGHT
WHILST I AM DOING SO YOU MUST BURN THE SKIN THEREUPON THEY BOTH WENT TO THE WOOD WITH THE CHILD
XIV THE TWELVE PRINCESSES WENT UPSTAIRS TO BED
THEN SHE CHANGED HERSELF INTO A DUCK AND LAY SWIMMING IN A LAKE THAT WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE PALACE
WELL SHE SIGHED THE QUEEN WISHES TO KILL ME AND IF I MUST DIE I MUST
WHEN THE GUARDS FOUND THAT THE PRINCE DID NOT ASK FOR HIS SUPPER AS USUAL THEY WENT INTO HIS ROOM AND NOT FINDING HIM THERE WERE VERY MUCH ALARMED AND SEARCHED THE TOWER FROM TURRET TO DUNGEON BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
WHEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER GOT TO CHURCH ALL THE PEOPLE WERE STANDING OUTSIDE UPON THE HILLSIDE AND ALL OF THEM WONDERED WHO ON EARTH SHE COULD BE AND THE PRINCE WAS ON THE ALERT IN A MOMENT AND CAME AND WANTED TO HOLD HER HORSE WHILE SHE ALIGHTED
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED HER A SCREECH OWL HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID THE KING VERY CROSSLY
THE PRINCESS KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND BEGGED TO BE LET IN THAT SHE MIGHT REST A LITTLE
TO BE SURE I'VE EMPTIED A WHOLE BARREL OF WINE BUT WHAT IS ONE DROP ON A HOT STONE I THINK I CAN HELP YOU SAID DULLHEAD
THE CARRIAGE INTENDED FOR THE PRINCESS ROSETTE HAD SIX BLUE MONKEYS WHICH COULD TURN SUMMER-SAULTS AND DANCE ON A TIGHT-ROPE AND DO MANY OTHER CHARMING TRICKS
THEN HE SET THE HORSE GRANI AT THE FIRE AND HE LEAPED THROUGH IT LIGHTLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROUGH THE HEATHER
I INTEND YOU TO BEHAVE PRETTILY TO HER
AT FIRST THE KING WOULD NOT BELIEVE THIS BUT AFTER A LONG LONG TIME THEY PREVAILED WITH HIM AND HE CREPT ON TIP-TOE TO THE DOOR PEEPED THROUGH AND SAW THE YOUTH ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED TOGETHER BEFORE A PICTURE WHICH WAS HANGING ON THE WALL
I AM AN ANGEL SENT TO ANNOUNCE TO THEE THAT BECAUSE OF THY PIETY THOU SHALT BE TAKEN AWAY ALIVE INTO HEAVEN SAID THE MASTER THIEF
SO ONE FINE MORNING DRAKESTAIL VERY SPRUCE AND FRESH TAKES THE ROAD SINGING
THE GIRL WILL CERTAINLY PERISH OF HUNGER AND COLD OUTSIDE AND I SHAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH HER ANY MORE THE GIRL WAS SO OBEDIENT THAT SHE PUT ON THE PAPER DRESS AND SET OUT WITH HER LITTLE BASKET
BUT I DARE NOT GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND SAY THIS
SO AGAIN THE HEADS TALKED TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO FOR THIS GIRL WHO WAS SO ILL-TEMPERED AND FULL OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE AND THEY AGREED THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE A NOSE THAT WAS FOUR ELLS LONG AND A JAW THAT WAS THREE ELLS AND A FIR BUSH IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FOREHEAD AND EVERY TIME SHE SPOKE ASHES SHOULD FALL FROM HER MOUTH
INSTANTLY OUT CAME SWARMS OF LITTLE MEN AND WOMEN NO TALLER THAN HER FINGER AND SCATTERED THEMSELVES ALL OVER THE MEADOW SINGING AND DANCING AND PLAYING THE MERRIEST GAMES SO THAT AT FIRST GRACIOSA WAS DELIGHTED AND WATCHED THEM WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT
THAT VERY SAME NIGHT AS SOON AS THE WICKED KING HAD GONE TO BED THE FAIRY CHANGED HERSELF INTO THE LITTLE MOUSE AND CREEPING UP ON TO HIS PILLOW NIBBLED HIS EAR SO THAT HE SQUEALED OUT QUITE LOUDLY AND TURNED OVER ON HIS OTHER SIDE
BUT NOW HOW SHALL WE HAVE IT MADE KNOWN THAT IT WAS YOU WHO SAVED ME SAID THE KING'S DAUGHTER
BUT IF YOU SEE THAT I AM WINNING FLING THE BRIDLE WHICH YOU MUST TAKE OFF ME OVER HIS HEAD AND THEN HE WILL BECOME QUITE GENTLE JUST AS THE YOUTH HAD FLUNG ALL THE HIDES WITH THE SPIKES OVER DAPPLEGRIM AND THE TAR OVER THE FIELD AND HAD GOT SAFELY UP INTO THE SPRUCE FIR A HORSE CAME WITH FLAME SPOUTING FROM HIS NOSTRILS AND THE TAR CAUGHT FIRE IN A MOMENT
AND THEY STARTED FOR HOME WITH THE CHILD
HE SAID THAT HE DID LIKE TO BE WITH THEM FOR THEY HAD ENOUGH TO LIVE ON AND HE WAS VERY COMFORTABLE THERE
TRY TO GIVE US OUR QUEEN AGAIN FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE REWARDED
WHEN HE SAW HER HE WAS VERY MUCH ASTONISHED AT HER BEAUTY WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE ANYONE LESS HARD-HEARTED SORRY FOR HER
NEXT SHE CROSSED HIGH ROCKY MOUNTAINS JUMPING FROM CRAG TO CRAG AND FROM PEAK TO PEAK
SOME WERE FAIR AND SOME WERE DARK
ON SEEING THE CAN DISAPPEAR SHE MADE SUCH A MISERABLE FACE THAT ZIZI WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING HER ALL THIS TIME BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER
WE WILL WE WILL THEN THERE WERE FEASTS AND FIREWORKS IN EVERY STREET IN THE TOWN AND EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE FAIRY WHO HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD IN THE NIGHT BROUGHT BACK WITH HER IN HER FLYING CHARIOT THE MOST HANDSOME AND GOOD-TEMPERED PRINCE SHE COULD FIND ANYWHERE
SO SHE TOLD HIM THAT THE KING HAD COME HOME AGAIN AND THAT THE QUEEN HAD PRETENDED TO BE ILL AND THAT SHE HAD MADE THE DOCTOR SAY THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE WELL AGAIN UNLESS SOME OF THE FLESH OF THE BLUE BULL WAS GIVEN HER TO EAT AND THAT NOW HE WAS TO BE KILLED
I THOUGHT I HAD HIDDEN YOU SAFELY FROM THE WHOLE WORLD AND IN SPITE OF IT YOU HAVE MANAGED TO DECEIVE ME IN HER WRATH SHE SEIZED RAPUNZEL'S BEAUTIFUL HAIR WOUND IT ROUND AND ROUND HER LEFT HAND AND THEN GRASPING A PAIR OF SCISSORS IN HER RIGHT SNIP SNAP OFF IT CAME AND THE BEAUTIFUL PLAITS LAY ON THE GROUND
BUT HE NOT KNOWING WHAT I HAD DONE IMAGINED IT WAS STILL ON SOME PART OF ME AND MADE A VIOLENT LEAP TO SEIZE ME WHEN HE WENT INTO THE POND OVER HEAD AND EARS AND WAS DROWNED
BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MOUNTAIN HE BROKE ONE OF HIS LEGS SO HE HAD TO GO HOME TO GET IT PUT RIGHT
I WILL TEACH YOU YELLED THE TROLL AND STRUCK AT HIM WITH HIS IRON CLUB SO THAT THE EARTH FLEW UP FIFTEEN YARDS HIGH INTO THE AIR
THE BULL GORED THE TROLL'S EYES OUT AND RAN HIS HORNS RIGHT THROUGH HIM BUT THE TROLL FOUGHT AS WELL AS HE DID AND WHEN THE BULL HAD GORED ONE HEAD TO DEATH THE OTHER HEADS BREATHED LIFE INTO IT AGAIN SO IT WAS A WHOLE WEEK BEFORE THE BULL WAS ABLE TO KILL HIM
THAT IS ALL THE WILD BIRDS IN THE FOREST FLYING ABOUT
MAYBLOSSOM WAS JUST ABOUT TO FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE WHEN A TERRIFIC CROAKING AS OF AN IMMENSE ARMY OF CROWS ROOKS RAVENS SCREECH-OWLS AND ALL BIRDS OF ILL-OMEN WAS HEARD AND AT THE SAME INSTANT A HUGE OWL SKIMMED UP TO THE PRINCESS AND THREW OVER HER A SCARF WOVEN OF SPIDERS WEBS AND EMBROIDERED WITH BATS WINGS
THE TINY DOOR SWUNG BACK AND A SOFT CRIMSON LIGHT GLEAMED OVER THE WHOLE CABINET
WHEN NIGHT CAME ON IT RAN HOME AND KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE LITTLE HOUSE CRIED
HE CARRIED HER HOME TO HIS WIFE AND THE GOOD WOMAN WAS SORRY FOR HER AND BROUGHT HER UP WITH HER OWN SONS
IF YOU DO NOT GET ALL THE MILK INTO THE DISH AGAIN BEFORE I COME HOME YOU WILL SUFFER FOR IT HOW FRIGHTENED THE GIRL WAS THIS TIME
THE YOUTH SEATED HIMSELF ON THE DAPPLED HORSE WHICH HE HAD CAPTURED AND RODE HOME AGAIN TO THE KING'S PALACE AND DAPPLEGRIM RAN LOOSE BY HIS SIDE
AND SHE HAD BEEN DETAINED ALL NIGHT THERE BY A STORM
SUCH A FELLOW AS HE WAS COULD NEVER TURN INTO SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE SIR IN A SHORT TIME THE OLD WOMAN HAD TO GO TO THE FIREPLACE TO STIR THE FIRE AND WHEN THE BLAZE LIT UP HALVOR AS IT USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT HOME RAKING UP THE ASHES SHE KNEW HIM AGAIN
BECOME A CRICKET AND INSTANTLY THE HANDSOME PRINCE PEERLESS BECAME A POOR LITTLE BLACK CRICKET WHOSE ONLY IDEA WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FIND HIMSELF A COSY CRANNY BEHIND SOME BLAZING HEARTH IF HE HAD NOT LUCKILY REMEMBERED THE FAIRY DOUCELINE'S INJUNCTION TO SEEK THE GOLDEN BRANCH
SHE MIXED SERPENT'S VENOM AND WOLF'S FLESH AND GAVE THEM IN ONE DISH TO HER HUSBAND'S YOUNGER BROTHER AND WHEN HE HAD TASTED THEM HE WAS MAD AND HE WENT INTO SIGURD'S CHAMBER WHILE HE SLEPT AND PINNED HIM TO THE BED WITH A SWORD
HE RODE ON STRUGGLING WITH HIS SUFFERINGS BUT AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE SUN OR THE STARS OR A HORSE OR A MONKEY OR A LION EXCEPT IN PICTURES AND THOUGH THE KING AND QUEEN TELL ME I AM TO BE SET FREE WHEN I AM TWENTY I BELIEVE THEY ONLY SAY IT TO KEEP ME AMUSED WHEN THEY NEVER MEAN TO LET ME OUT AT ALL AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND HER NURSE AND THE NURSE'S DAUGHTER AND THE CRADLE-ROCKER AND THE NURSERY-MAID WHO ALL LOVED HER DEARLY CRIED TOO FOR COMPANY SO THAT NOTHING COULD BE HEARD BUT SOBS AND SIGHS
FOR TILL THEN THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THOSE WHO HAD HEARD THE VOICE AND OBEYED ITS CALL
POOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOUND IT A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT HIM HE WAS SO STRAIGHT AND STRONG
TIME HANGS VERY HEAVILY ON MY HANDS WHEN I'M ALL ALONE IN THE WOOD
TIME HANGS VERY HEAVILY ON MY HANDS WHEN I'M ALL ALONE IN THE WOOD
WHAT CAN BE THE REASON I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE PRINCE
HIS FATHER ORDERED THIS TO BE DONE
WHEREUPON THE YOUTH IMMEDIATELY APPEARED STANDING THERE ON THE STABLE FLOOR
THEN MINNIKIN WENT ONWARDS AND WHEN HE HAD WANDERED ON FOR SOME TIME HE AGAIN MET AN OLD OLD CROOK-BACKED HAG WHO HAD ONLY ONE EYE
THEY MAY EVEN MEET WITH THEIR DEATH THROUGH HER
SO THEY GOT READY AND FLED
AND QUACK QUACK QUACK DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING AND SPRUCE AS BEFORE
SHE HAD GONE WITH HER INFANT SON WHO WAS ONLY TWO OR THREE MONTHS OLD TO VISIT HER OLD NURSE WHO LIVED IN THE VALLEY
IF YOU WILL GIVE ME WHAT YOUR WIFE SHOWS YOU WHEN YOU GO HOME YOU SHALL CATCH FISH ENOUGH SO THE MAN SAID YES IN A MOMENT AND THEN HE CAUGHT FISH IN PLENTY
THESE COFFINS SHE SAID WERE INTENDED FOR YOUR BROTHERS BUT THEY STOLE SECRETLY AWAY BEFORE YOU WERE BORN THEN SHE TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED HER DAUGHTER SAID
DO CHRISTIAN FOLK DARE TO COME HERE CRIED THE SECOND PRINCESS
THERE SHE SAID
THE FIRST THING HE WAS TOLD WAS THAT WHEN THE PRINCESSES GOT UP HE WAS TO PRESENT EACH ONE WITH A BOUQUET AND MICHAEL THOUGHT THAT IF HE HAD NOTHING MORE UNPLEASANT TO DO THAN THAT HE SHOULD GET ON VERY WELL
FINE WARES FOR SALE SNOWDROP LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAID
AH MADAM SAID THE FATTER OF THE TWO I HAVE SUCH A PAIN IN MY SIDE FROM RUNNING SO FAST
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
OH
IT LAYS AS WELL AS IT DID WHEN IT BELONGED TO THAT PALTRY KNIGHT HE SAID
THEY WERE YOUR TWELVE BROTHERS
THAT WAS NO PART OF OUR BARGAIN SAID THE MAN AND THE HALTER YOU SHALL NOT HAVE FOR I HAVE OTHER HORSES WHICH I SHALL HAVE TO SELL SO EACH OF THEM WENT HIS WAY
NOW SHE SAID THOU SHALT GO INTO THE CASTLE AND LET THE TROLLS BEAT THEE ONE NIGHT FOR EACH OF US AND IF THOU CANST BUT ENDURE THAT THOU WILT SET US FREE YES ANSWERED THE LAD I WILL CERTAINLY TRY TO DO SO WHEN THOU GOEST IN CONTINUED THE PRINCESS TWO LIONS WILL STAND BY THE DOORWAY BUT IF THOU ONLY GOEST STRAIGHT BETWEEN THEM THEY WILL DO THEE NO HARM
BUT AS WAS NATURAL THEY ONLY LAUGHED AT THE STAR GAZER
WHOEVER THOU ART THAT HAST SLAIN ME THIS GOLD SHALL BE THY RUIN AND THE RUIN OF ALL WHO OWN IT SIGURD SAID
THEN DAPPLEGRIM INQUIRED WHY HE WAS SO TROUBLED AND THE YOUTH TOLD HIM AND SAID THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR AS TO SETTING THE PRINCESS FREE THAT WAS DOWNRIGHT IMPOSSIBLE OH BUT IT MIGHT BE DONE SAID DAPPLEGRIM
I HAVE MORE BEAUTY IN MY LITTLE FINGER THAN SHE HAS IN HER WHOLE BODY SOON AFTER THIS TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS THE QUEEN WAS TAKEN ILL AND DIED AND THE KING BECAME SO MELANCHOLY THAT FOR A WHOLE YEAR HE SHUT HIMSELF UP IN HIS PALACE
IN TIMES OF YORE THERE WAS A KING AND A QUEEN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND WHO HAD THREE SONS ALL BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN
WHEN THE PRINCESS HAD THANKED HER ONCE MORE FOR HER HOSPITALITY AND FOR HER GOOD ADVICE AND HAD THROWN AWAY ONE PAIR OF SHOES THAT WERE WORN OUT AND HAD PUT ON A SECOND PAIR SHE TIED UP THE CHICKEN BONES IN A BUNDLE AND TAKING HER BABY IN HER ARMS AND HER STAFF IN HER HAND SHE SET OUT ONCE MORE ON HER WANDERINGS
HE WEPT AND WEPT
THE QUEEN COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW HER STEP-DAUGHTER COULD LOOK SO WELL ON SUCH BAD FOOD SO SHE ORDERED ONE OF HER HANDMAIDENS TO FOLLOW HER INTO THE WOOD AND WATCH HER AND SEE HOW IT WAS FOR SHE THOUGHT THAT SOME OF THE SERVANTS MUST BE GIVING HER FOOD
THE HUNTSMAN REMEMBERED ALL THIS CAREFULLY AND WENT OFF STRAIGHT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM ALL HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD
ONE DAY A BIG WASHING WAS GOING ON AT THE PALACE AND THE GIRL LOOKING DOWN FROM HER WINDOW SAW TWELVE MEN'S SHIRTS HANGING UP TO DRY AND ASKED HER MOTHER
SHE WENT THERE FIRST AND HALVOR FOLLOWED HER
AND FOR THREE DAYS EVERYBODY WHO CAME TO SEE THE PRINCESS WAS PRESENTED WITH A SLICE OF BREAD-AND-JAM A NIGHTINGALE'S EGG AND SOME HIPPOCRAS
I AM NOT SO UNGRATEFUL AS YOU THINK
THERE WAS SOME STRAW IN A CORNER WHICH WAS ALL SHE HAD FOR A BED AND THEY GAVE HER A VERY LITTLE BIT OF BLACK BREAD TO EAT
IT'S A WOLF IS IT SAID HE
HE WALKED ON AND ON FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND WHEN NIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO FALL HE CAME TO A ROYAL PALACE
THE MAN DID SO AND IT TURNED INTO A GREAT HIGH MOUNTAIN OF STONE WHICH FARMER WEATHERBEARD HAD TO BREAK HIS WAY THROUGH BEFORE HE COULD FOLLOW THEM
FANFARONADE SAID THE PRINCESS SITTING UP AND RUBBING HER EYES IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WHEN I AM HERE WITH YOU YOU CAN WANT ANYTHING ELSE
CLOSE BESIDE THE ROCK A STICK IS STANDING AND WHEN YOU WANT ME FOR ANYTHING YOU HAVE ONLY TO KNOCK AT THE WALL OF ROCK WITH THAT AT FIRST SHE WOULD NOT DO IT BUT WHEN THE BULL SAID THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT HE WOULD HAVE FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR HER SHE COULD DO NO OTHERWISE
AND SHE HAD JUST RISEN TO RETURN TO THE PALACE WHEN SHE HEARD PEALS OF MALICIOUS LAUGHTER BEHIND HER AND TURNING ROUND SAW THE UGLY STRANGER WHOM SHE HAD DISMISSED WHO WAS MAKING VERY MERRY OVER THE DISASTERS AND MOCKING EVERYONE BUT ESPECIALLY THE QUEEN
SHE TOOK THE STAR GAZER ASIDE AND SAID TO HIM IN A HARSH VOICE
THEN SUDDENLY SHE BE-THOUGHT HER OF THE CHICKEN BONES THAT SHE HAD DRAGGED ALL THAT WEARY WAY AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF
THEN THEY WEPT BITTERLY BECAUSE THE PRINCE HAD NOT COME AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HOLD OUT ANY LONGER
THERE IS SOMEBODY BEHIND ME CRIED THE PRINCESS
SO THE PRINCESS SAID THAT HE WAS TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE FLASK WHICH HUNG BY ITS SIDE AND WHEN HE HAD DONE THAT HE COULD WIELD THE SWORD
AT DAYBREAK ON THE THIRD DAY HE SAW A PALACE GRANDER THAN THE FIRST TWO AND NEAR THE PALACE STOOD AN OAK AND ON THE OAK SAT A RAVEN
WHERE IS YOUR PITCHER ASKED THE BRICKLAYER
WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO FIGHT WITH THIS DRAGON THEN HIS TUTOR WHOSE NAME WAS REGIN TOLD HIM THAT ALL THIS GREAT HOARD OF RED GOLD HAD ONCE BELONGED TO HIS OWN FATHER
LET ME HAVE IT THEN SAID MINNIKIN
LET ME HAVE IT THEN SAID MINNIKIN
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS FATHER'S AND MOTHER'S ENTREATIES HE WOULD NOT STAY BUT BADE THEM FAREWELL SAYING THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE FOR IF HE DID NOT FIND THE PRINCESS AGAIN HE DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO LIVE
WELL I MUST SAY CURLICUE IS UGLY ENOUGH BUT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE CONSENTING TO MARRY HIM SIRE SHE REPLIED I KNOW TOO WELL WHAT I AM LIKE TO BE HURT BY WHAT YOU SAY BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NO WISH TO MARRY YOUR SON I HAD RATHER BE CALLED PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK THAN QUEEN CURLICUE THIS MADE KING GRUMPY VERY ANGRY
WHEN SHE WALKED IN AND SAID
SO DOWN THEY WENT TOGETHER AND THE KING SEEING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED GREAT CASKS RANGED SIDE BY SIDE ASKED IF IT WAS ONLY FOR HERSELF THAT SHE HAD THIS IMMENSE STORE OF WINE
THEN SHE TOOK HER RING FROM HIM AND PUT ANOTHER IN ITS PLACE AND THEN SHE SAID TO HER SISTERS
THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER ADVENTURES AND HE WEPT WITH PITY AT THE TALE
THE PRINCESS ASKED PRINCE PEERLESS AS HE KNEW THE COUNTRY BETTER THAN SHE DID TO TELL HER OF SOME PEASANT WHO WOULD GIVE HER A LODGING AND HE SAID HE KNEW OF AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE COTTAGE WOULD BE THE VERY PLACE FOR HER IT WAS SO NICE AND SO PRETTY
WHEN THEY HAD SETTLED THEIR BARGAIN THE OLD WOMAN SAID
I MEAN TO WANDER AS FAR AS THE BLUE SKY STRETCHES OVER THE EARTH TILL I FIND THEM THEN SHE SHOWED HIM THE TWELVE SHIRTS WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN WITH HER AND BENJAMIN SAW THAT IT MUST BE HIS SISTER AND SAID
THE NURSE RESTORED TO ROSETTE ALL HER DRESSES AND JEWELS AND THE BUSHEL OF GOLD PIECES
YES I WILL GO TOO SAID CINDERLAD FOR I HAVE TAKEN IT INTO MY HEAD THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
AND IT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT THE LIGHT GLANCED OFF ITS COAT
THEY NEXT CROSSED ANOTHER WOOD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE SPRINKLED WITH GOLD AND AFTER THAT ANOTHER STILL WHERE THE LEAVES GLITTERED WITH DIAMONDS
FARMER WEATHERBEARD CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A HARE WHICH SCRATCHED AND SCRAPED ABOUT IN THE FIREPLACE AFTER THE RING UNTIL THE ASHES WERE UP TO ITS EARS
YES SAID MINNIKIN IT IS IT IS WELL THEN THAT I HAVE LIGHTED ON THEE SAID THE TROLL
WHEN THE KING CAME HOME AND WISHED TO SPEAK TO HIS WIFE THE WOMAN CALLED OUT
BUT IT CHANCED THAT HE TOUCHED IT WITH HIS FINGER AND IT BURNED HIM
AS SHE WAS WALKING OUT OF CHURCH THE PRINCE FOLLOWED HER AND SHUT THE CHURCH DOOR AFTER HER AND THUS HE KEPT ONE OF HER GLOVES IN HIS HAND
WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU ARE STANDING FIGHTING ABOUT FOR EVER AND EVER SAID HE TO THE BROTHERS
YOU SHALL BE HUNG
I AM JUST ON MY WAY THERE TO DRY THE CLOTHES FOR THE WEDDING WHICH IS TO TAKE PLACE
WHEN THE MOMENT ARRIVED TO SERVE THE ROAST GOOSE THERE WAS A PAUSE AND TUBBY TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO LAY DOWN HIS KNIFE AND FORK FOR A LITTLE
THE NEXT WAS OTTER WHO COULD PUT ON THE SHAPE OF AN OTTER WHEN HE LIKED
STILL HIS HEART WAS LIGHT FOR HE FELT THAT HE HAD GOT THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF HIS TASK AND THE REST WAS EASY
SOME HAD CHESTNUT HAIR OR CURLS DARKER STILL AND SOME HAD GOLDEN LOCKS
HE CARRIED HIS BASKET TO THE PRINCESS WHO AT ONCE SENT HIM BACK TO THE PANTRY TO BRING ALL THE TARTS AND SUGAR PLUMS THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE KING'S SUPPER
POOR GIRL HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
AS SOON AS JACK SAW HER HE TURNED TO RUN AWAY BUT SHE CAUGHT HIM AND DRAGGED HIM INTO THE CASTLE
THE FAIRY WENT AND BROUGHT HIS MOTHER TO HIM WITH THE HEN AND THE HARP
WHEN THE DAY BROKE SHE AND FRISK WERE EQUALLY ASTONISHED AT FINDING THEMSELVES ALONE UPON THE SEA WITH NO BOAT AND NO ONE TO HELP THEM
THE GIANTESS SOON OPENED THE DOOR
SUDDENLY HE HEARD FIERCE HOWLS AND A DOG AS TALL AS A DONKEY WITH EYES LIKE BILLIARD BALLS CAME TOWARDS HIM SHOWING HIS TEETH WHICH WERE LIKE THE PRONGS OF A FORK
BUT SHE JUMPED OFF AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THAT FOR THE HORSE WAS SO WELL BROKEN IN THAT IT STOOD STILL WHEN SHE BADE IT AND CAME WHEN SHE CALLED IT
THEN IMMEDIATELY HE UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF BIRDS AND HE HEARD THE WOODPECKERS SAY
HE WAS ALL IMPATIENCE TO SEE THE LOVELY PRINCESS BUT WHEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE NURSE'S DAUGHTER HE WAS FURIOUSLY ANGRY AND WOULD NOT ADVANCE ANOTHER STEP
BUT FANFARONADE SEEING THAT SHE HAD FOUND SOMETHING GOOD AND WAS NOT GOING TO SHARE IT WITH HIM RAN AFTER HER IN SUCH A FURY THAT SHE HASTILY DREW OUT THE QUEEN'S CARBUNCLE WHICH HAD THE PROPERTY OF RENDERING PEOPLE INVISIBLE IF THEY WERE IN DANGER AND WHEN SHE WAS SAFELY HIDDEN FROM HIM SHE REPROACHED HIM GENTLY FOR HIS UNKINDNESS
THE QUEEN WITHOUT GIVING HER ANOTHER THOUGHT CHOSE A PRETTY ROSY-FACED NURSE BUT NO SOONER WAS HER CHOICE MADE THAN A SNAKE WHICH WAS HIDDEN IN THE GRASS BIT THAT VERY NURSE ON HER FOOT SO THAT SHE FELL DOWN AS IF DEAD
WHEN HE HAD GONE SOME DISTANCE HE CAME TO A MOUNTAIN WHERE HE MET A MAN WHO WAS LORD OVER ALL THE BEASTS IN THE FOREST--FOR THEY ALL CAME TO HIM WHEN HE BLEW A HORN WHICH HE HAD
THE MONEY BAGS
AT LAST YOU HAVE COME TO SEE ME PRINCE SAID SHE
THEN HE ASKED THE QUEEN WHO WAS DRESSED LIKE A MAID HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING NEAR THE DAWN MY FATHER GAVE ME A GOLD RING SAID SHE AND ALWAYS ERE THE DAWNING IT GROWS COLD ON MY FINGER A RICH HOUSE WHERE THE MAIDS WORE GOLD SAID THE KING
AND HIS MASTER REPLIED
THE PRINCESS STOOD UP WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND HER HEART BEAT WITH FEAR FOR SHE DID NOT KNOW HIM
SO HE CALLED A SECOND TIME AND A LITTLE LOUDER BUT NO
WHY IS HE A PIG BY DAY AND A HUMAN BEING BY NIGHT I WAS JUST GOING TO TELL YOU THAT ONE THING MY DEAR TO SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD FORTUNE-TELLER I AM
YOU HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE SO PRETTY AND DAINTY THAT NO ONE WAS EQUAL TO YOU SAID HALVOR BUT YOU SHOULD JUST SEE THE ELDEST PRINCESS WHOM I SET FREE
WAIT A LITTLE STILL PLEADED RENELDE
KING GRUMPY WHO CARED A GREAT DEAL MORE FOR HIS OWN GRANDEUR THAN FOR HIS SON'S HAPPINESS WISHED TO BETROTH THE PRINCE TO THE DAUGHTER OF A NEIGHBOURING KING WHOSE GREAT ESTATES JOINED HIS OWN FOR HE THOUGHT THAT THIS ALLIANCE WOULD MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER AND AS FOR THE PRINCESS SHE WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOR SHE WAS AS UGLY AS HIMSELF
KNOWING THAT THE KING WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THEIR HEADS CUT OFF FOR ALLOWING THE PRINCE TO ESCAPE THEY THEN AGREED TO SAY THAT HE WAS ILL AND AFTER MAKING THE SMALLEST AMONG THEM LOOK AS MUCH LIKE PRINCE CURLICUE AS POSSIBLE THEY PUT HIM INTO HIS BED AND SENT TO INFORM THE KING
BUT NO ONE KNEW HER--NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HER
WHEN THEY REACHED THE PALACE THE KING KISSED HIS DAUGHTER ON BOTH CHEEKS AND SAID
MINNIKIN THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A COUPLE OF NEEDY FOLK WHO LIVED IN A WRETCHED HUT IN WHICH THERE WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK WANT
FOR NOW I TOO SHALL BE ABLE TO RIDE TO CHURCH SHE SAID
IT WAS SHE WHO HAD FRIGHTENED ZIZI BY APPEARING WITH HER PITCHER ON HER SHOULDER
HE AGAIN HAD THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH HE PUT INTO HIS POCKET AND WENT ON HIS WAY
BRANDY
THE KING WAS RATHER PLEASED WITH THIS IDEA AND SHUT THE QUEEN UP IN THE HIGHEST ROOM OF A TALL TOWER WHICH WAS VERY TINY AND MISERABLY FURNISHED WITH A TABLE AND A VERY HARD BED UPON THE FLOOR
AND HE ADDED
HE NEVER LEFT HER SIDE AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE CASTLE ROOMS
GOOD-EVENING TO YOU TOO SAID THE OLD WOMAN
ARE WE PURSUED THINK YOU
HE LIFTED HIS GLITTERING AXE AND PLACED HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE MUSICIAN AS MUCH AS TO SAY
I WILL BE CALLED MINNIKIN ANSWERED THE SECOND
I KNOW YOUR TROUBLE MADAM
WELL THEY WENT TO A GREAT MANY MASTERS BUT ALL SAID THAT THEY COULD MAKE THE LAD AS GOOD AS THEY WERE THEMSELVES BUT BETTER THAN THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE HIM
MADNESS IN YOUTH IS TRUE WISDOM
JACK AND THE BEANSTALK JACK SELLS THE COW ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A POOR WIDOW WHO LIVED IN A LITTLE COTTAGE WITH HER ONLY SON JACK
MY DEAREST BENJAMIN YOUR FATHER HAS HAD THESE COFFINS MADE FOR YOU AND YOUR ELEVEN BROTHERS BECAUSE IF I BRING A GIRL INTO THE WORLD YOU ARE ALL TO BE KILLED AND BURIED IN THEM SHE WEPT BITTERLY AS SHE SPOKE BUT HER SON COMFORTED HER AND SAID
WHO DRINKS OF ME WILL BE A ROE AND SHE BEGGED AH
EVERY TIME THE KING AND QUEEN CAME TO SEE HER THEY WERE MORE DELIGHTED WITH HER THAN BEFORE BUT THOUGH SHE WAS WEARY OF THE TOWER AND OFTEN BEGGED THEM TO TAKE HER AWAY FROM IT THEY ALWAYS REFUSED
YOU ARE MOST FAIR MY LADY QUEEN NONE FAIRER IN THE LAND I WEEN THEN SHE WAS QUITE HAPPY FOR SHE KNEW THE MIRROR ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH
AND THEN SHE RODE AWAY TO THE PALACE AS BEFORE
COME PEOPLE ALL
AND AT DINNER AND SUPPER TIME THE QUEEN GAVE IT THE THREE PEAS AND THE BIT OF BLACK BREAD AND ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING GOOD IN THE DISH IN THEIR PLACE
THIS ACCIDENT GAVE JACK TIME TO GET ON THE BEANSTALK AND HASTEN DOWN IT
SO TO PASS THE TIME THEY DECIDED TO WORK FOR PART OF THE DAY TO READ FOR PART OF THE DAY AND TO ENJOY THEMSELVES IN THE GARDEN FOR PART OF THE DAY
AS SOON AS RITTER RED SAW THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY DANGER AFOOT HE CREPT DOWN FROM THE TREE AND THREATENED THE PRINCESS UNTIL AT LAST SHE WAS AGAIN FORCED TO PROMISE TO SAY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD RESCUED HER
I GREATLY FEAR THAT THE KING HIS MASTER WHEN HE RECEIVES NO TIDINGS FROM HIM WILL COME TO SEEK HIM AMONG US AND WILL ACCUSE US OF HAVING MADE MINCE-MEAT OF HIM
IT WOULD BE EASY TO CLIMB IT THOUGHT JACK
AS THE KING AND THE PRINCE HAD TO STAY IN PRISON THEY SENT A LETTER TO THE PRINCESS TELLING HER TO PACK UP ALL HER TREASURES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND COME TO THEM AS THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WAS WAITING TO MARRY HER
WELL SAID THE BULL I KNOW WHAT IT IS THOUGH YOU WILL NOT TELL ME
THEN SHE CAREFULLY SHOOK UP THE PILLOWS OF THE LITTLE BED LAID THE BABY DOWN AND TUCKED THE COVERLET IN ALL ROUND HIM
WHEN HE HAD GOT INSIDE HE FOUND THE OTHER PRINCESS SITTING SEWING BUT WHEN SHE SAW MINNIKIN SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS
I WILL CUT YOU TO BITS THEN HE TOOK MARYA MOREVNA FROM HIM AND CARRIED HER OFF
IN DESPAIR HE CRIED
BUT LITTLE SISTER SAID HE WHERE SHALL WE FIND THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS OH
THAT EVENING TUBBY AND HIS SON ATE THE GOLDEN APPLES AT SUPPER AND THOUGHT THEM DELICIOUS
BUT WHEN THE WITCH WIFE SAW THEM SHE RAN AWAY WITH HER DAUGHTER AND IF SHE HAS NOT STOPPED SHE IS RUNNING STILL THOUGH AT A GREAT AGE
SO FARMER WEATHERBEARD WENT AWAY WITH THE HORSE
BUT AT THAT MOMENT PRINCE IVAN'S HORSE SMOTE KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS FULL SWING WITH ITS HOOF AND CRACKED HIS SKULL AND THE PRINCE MADE AN END OF HIM WITH A CLUB
NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED ME MOTHER THIS HUNDRED YEARS CAN I LODGE HERE TO-NIGHT SAID THE MAN
IF NOT IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCE WHO HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED WAS FAIRLY TERRIFIED AND DROPPING THE BOOK WITH A CRASH HE SANK BACK INSENSIBLE
DESIRE WAITED TO BID HIM GOOD-BYE UNTIL HE WAS QUIET AGAIN
WELL THESE EVENTS HAD ALMOST BEEN FORGOTTEN WHEN ONE FINE DAY A PRINCE FROM THE EAST APPEARED AT THE COURT AND ASKED THE KING FOR THE HAND OF HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER
III WHEN DESIRE THOUGHT THEY COULD NO LONGER CATCH HIM HE PULLED HIS HORSE INTO A WALK LIKE A PRUDENT MAN WHO KNOWS HE HAS FAR TO GO
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE KING'S PALACE THE KITCHEN-MAID CLAPPED HER HANDS AND WONDERED WHERE HE COULD HAVE GOT ALL THAT GOLD AND SILVER
IF HE CAN STEAL THE JOINT OFF THE SPIT IN THE KITCHEN ON SUNDAY WHEN EVERY ONE OF US IS WATCHING IT HE SHALL HAVE MY DAUGHTER
AND THEN WE MUST NOT HURT THE COUNT
ONE DAY HOWEVER A SEA CAPTAIN CAME AND ASKED HALVOR IF HE HADN'T A FANCY TO COME WITH HIM AND GO TO SEA AND BEHOLD FOREIGN LANDS
WHEN ROSETTE RECEIVED THE LETTER SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE RAN ABOUT TELLING EVERYONE THAT THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS WAS FOUND AND SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY HIM
HIS SURPRISE WAS GREAT WHEN HE PRESENTLY SAW A LITTLE GREEN DOG WITH ONE EAR SLIP SOFTLY INTO THE KITCHEN UNCOVER THE POT TRANSFER ALL ITS CONTENTS TO HIS BASKET AND RUN OFF
THE BULL TOLD THE KING'S DAUGHTER THAT ON NO ACCOUNT WAS SHE TO TOUCH IT FOR THERE WAS A TROLL WITH NINE HEADS WHO WAS THE OWNER AND THAT HE WAS MUCH LARGER AND STRONGER THAN BOTH THE OTHERS PUT TOGETHER AND THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE COULD OVERCOME HIM
AND NOW MY DAUGHTER WHAT IS TO BE DONE SAID THE OLD MAN
BUT RED-HOT IRON SHOES HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR THE WICKED OLD QUEEN AND SHE WAS MADE TO GET INTO THEM AND DANCE TILL SHE FELL DOWN DEAD.(29 29 GRIMM
AND IN ORDER TO TURN HIS HEAD MORE COMPLETELY COMPLIMENTS AND FLATTERY WERE HEAPED ON HIM FROM EVERY SIDE
IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE YES THAT IS WHERE WE ARE TO GO IN SAID THE FOAL
SO HE WALKED AND RODE THE WHOLE DAY THROUGH A GREAT WOOD WHERE THERE WERE MANY GREEN PLACES WHICH GLEAMED VERY PRETTILY AMONG THE TREES
RIVER RIVER OUTWARD FLOW OR TO DEATH DRAKESTAIL MUST GO MY FRIEND RIVER HASTENS OUT AND ERROUF
THE PRINCE KNEW HER IN A MOMENT AND WAS SO GLAD THAT HE RAN AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT SHE WAS A KING'S DAUGHTER HE WAS GLADDER STILL AND THEN THEY HAD THE WEDDING.(14 14 FROM P
MAMMA AND THE WOLF ONLY CAUGHT HER LITTLE HOOD
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK GREAT WAS THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF DESIRE
BUT WHEN MINNIKIN HAD WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO SEE WHAT HIS SHIP COULD DO
OH WELL
WHEN SHE STEPPED FROM THE BOAT AND THE ESCORT SENT BY THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER THEY WERE SO SURPRISED THAT THEY COULD NOT SAY A SINGLE WORD
WE BOTH LOVED THE SAME FAIRY BUT SHE PREFERRED ME
WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE MARRIAGE-FEAST WITH THE SEVEN PRINCES THE KING WAS SO JOYFUL THAT HE BOTH KISSED CINDERLAD AND CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND HIS BRIDE WAS STILL MORE DELIGHTED WITH HIM THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE
IT WAS SHE WHO IN THE DISGUISE OF AN OLD WOMAN GAVE YOU THE THREAD TO BIND ROUND MY FOOT
THOUGH I HAVE SERVED YOU LONG YOU NEVER GAVE ME ANY BREAD
WHEN THE HORSE WHICH THE DUCHESS WAS TO RIDE APPEARED BESIDE GRACIOSA'S IT LOOKED NO BETTER THAN AN OLD CART HORSE AND AS TO THEIR TRAPPINGS THERE WAS SIMPLY NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THEM AS THE PRINCESS'S SADDLE AND BRIDLE WERE ONE GLITTERING MASS OF DIAMONDS
HE REQUIRED DULLHEAD TO FIND A MAN WHO COULD EAT A MOUNTAIN OF BREAD
THE YOUTH CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A GREAT BLACK HORSE AND TOLD HIS FATHER THAT IF A MAN CAME AND OFFERED HIM THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND TREATED HIM WELL AND HANDSOMELY INTO THE BARGAIN HE WAS TO SELL HIM BUT WHATSOEVER HE DID OR HOW MUCH SOEVER HE DRANK HE MUST NOT FORGET TO TAKE OFF THE HALTER OR ELSE HE HIMSELF WOULD NEVER GET AWAY FROM FARMER WEATHERBEARD AS LONG AS HE LIVED
HOWEVER I LEFT THE SPIT STICKING IN HIS HEAD AND TOOK TO MY HEELS
THE YOUNG WOMAN STRIPT OFF THE REINDEER SKIN AND LET THE WIDOW WOMAN DO AS SHE WISHED
WHEN THEY MET THE DUCHESS GRUMBLY SHE WAS SEATED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE TRYING IN VAIN TO LOOK DIGNIFIED
THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE AND THE NURSES AFTER THEY HAD MADE THEIR CURTSEY TO THE KING AND QUEEN RANGED THEMSELVES IN A LINE BEFORE HER THAT SHE MIGHT CHOOSE
WHEN HE SAW HER HE FIRED A SHOT AT HER AS HE WOULD HAVE FIRED AT A WILD BEAST
I WILL OBEY HE HAD REALLY BEEN PRESENT INVISIBLE AT THE COUNCIL OF PRINCESSES AND HAD HEARD ALL
BUT JACK'S FRESH FACE LOOKED SO INNOCENT THAT SHE COULD NOT RESIST HIM AND SO SHE BADE HIM COME IN AND AGAIN HID HIM AWAY IN THE WARDROBE
AND BESIDES THE COUNT SEEMED MADE OF IRON AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH OFTEN BOASTING THAT HE SHOULD LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED
UP AT THE FARM A GREAT FEAST WAS MADE READY FOR THE PRINCESSES AND MUCH RESPECT PAID TO THEM BUT THEY WOULD NOT STAY THERE
BUT THE WICKED KING ONLY LAUGHED AND MOCKED AT HER AND CRIED
SO STEPPING BEFORE HER MIRROR ONE DAY SHE SAID
THE OTHER ONE WAS STEALING QUIETLY TO THE DOOR
THEY LIFTED HER UP TENDERLY AND WHEN THEY SAW HOW TIGHTLY LACED SHE WAS THEY CUT THE LACE IN TWO AND SHE BEGAN TO BREATHE A LITTLE AND GRADUALLY CAME BACK TO LIFE
THE ELDEST THOUGHT TO HERSELF
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS DO NOT ENTER THE CASTLE BUT GO ROUND IT AND ENTER THE ORANGE GROVE
VERY SOON VERY SOON THEN THE NURSE SAID
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN A GREAT DELIGHT IN PAINTING ME SINCE I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY SHE SAID TO HERSELF
AND IF A GIRL THOU SHALT BE MY OWN SISTER THEREUPON HE CAME FORTH
GOOD HEAVENS SAID THE GOVERNOR HAS HE ACTUALLY GOT THE BETTER OF ME AGAIN WHEN DAY CAME THE MASTER THIEF CAME TOO AND WANTED TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER AS HAD BEEN PROMISED AND THE GOVERNOR DARED DO NO OTHERWISE THAN GIVE HER TO HIM AND MUCH MONEY BESIDES FOR HE FEARED THAT IF HE DID NOT THE MASTER THIEF MIGHT STEAL THE VERY EYES OUT OF HIS HEAD AND THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE ILL SPOKEN OF BY ALL MEN
AHA
HOWEVER TO MAKE UP THE OTHER GUESTS ATE GREEDILY AND AS FOR TUBBY NOTHING EVER TOOK AWAY HIS APPETITE
DIDST THOU DO THAT
I'LL GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU LIKE FOR IT BUT THE DWARF SAID
THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINDFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS WHEN SIGURD HEARD ALL THIS AND HOW REGIN WAS PLOTTING TO BETRAY HIM HE CUT OFF REGIN'S HEAD WITH ONE BLOW OF THE SWORD GRAM
THE GIANT WHEN HIS WIFE WAS GONE TOOK OUT HEAPS AND HEAPS OF GOLDEN PIECES AND COUNTED THEM AND PUT THEM IN PILES TILL HE WAS TIRED OF THE AMUSEMENT
SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER LOVE FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK BURST INTO TEARS AND EXCLAIMED
NO CHRISTIAN FOLK HAVE BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS SO HALVOR TOLD HER THAT HE WANTED TO GET TO SORIA MORIA CASTLE AND INQUIRED IF SHE KNEW THE WAY THITHER
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INSIDE THE HOUSE ARE ALL SO SOUND ASLEEP THAT IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO AWAKE THEM
SPLENDID CLOTHING WAS GIVEN TO HER AND A HORSE WITH HAIR PARTLY OF GOLD PARTLY OF SILVER AND PARTLY OF SOMETHING MORE PRECIOUS STILL
DO YOU CARE MORE FOR A MISERABLE MOUSE THAN FOR YOUR OWN BABY
KEEP YOUR RECOMPENSE FOR YOURSELF REPLIED THE RATCATCHER PROUDLY
WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON AT COURT LET US SEE WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING TO THE REAL PRINCESS
SURELY THEY ARE FAR TOO SMALL FOR MY FATHER AND THE QUEEN ANSWERED SADLY
PLANT THESE TWO LAURELS IN TWO LARGE POTS RAKE THEM OVER WITH THE RAKE WATER THEM WITH THE BUCKET AND WIPE THEM WITH THE TOWEL
BUT THIS I DO SAY THAT YOU ARE TO HAVE HIM MADE A MASTER OVER ALL MASTERS THEN SHE ONCE MORE PUT SOME FOOD AND A ROLL OF TOBACCO INTO THE BAG AND THE MAN AND HIS SON HAD TO SET OUT AGAIN
EVERYONE HAD AS MANY CAKES AND SWEETMEATS AS HE WANTED
V NEVERTHELESS THE STAR GAZER HAD ANOTHER DREAM
A LONG TIME HAS PASSED SINCE I FIRST BEGAN TO SCOUR THIS OVEN WITH MY OWN FLESH
ON THE THIRD NIGHT A TROLL CAME WHO HAD NINE HEADS AND NINE RODS AND HE STRUCK THE LAD AND FLOGGED HIM SO LONG THAT AT LAST HE SWOONED AWAY
BUT HE LONGED TO GO HOME FOR HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WERE ALIVE AND HE HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO SEE THEM AGAIN
HE RODE TO THE PALACE AND IT WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAT WITH SUCH A HORSE AS HE HAD HE WAS NOT LONG ON THE WAY
HENRI CARNOY FOR THE SAME PRIVILEGE IN REGARD TO THE SIX SILLIES FROM LA TRADITION
ALAS SHE SAID THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS MUST HAVE ORDERED ME TO BE THROWN INTO THE SEA BECAUSE HE HAD CHANGED HIS MIND AND DID NOT WANT TO MARRY ME
GUNS WERE FIRED AND FIREWORKS LET OFF
IF MY SISTERS WERE BUT FREE TOO WHERE ARE THEY ASKED HALVOR
MAY I ASK WHERE YOU ARE GOING I WILL TELL YOU ANSWERED DESIRE THOUGH MOST LIKELY YOU WILL LAUGH AT ME
AND AGAIN THE KING'S DAUGHTER SAID TO HIM SLEEP A WHILE ON MY LAP AND WHILE MINNIKIN LAY THERE SHE DREW SOME SILVER RAIMENT OVER HIM
THAT WAS NOT MUCH OF A BLOW
THAT WAS NOT MUCH OF A BLOW
THAT WAS NOT MUCH OF A BLOW
I'LL COME BACK TWICE AND THEN FAREWELL THE NURSE MADE NO ANSWER BUT AS SOON AS THE QUEEN HAD DISAPPEARED SHE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM ALL
AFTER THEY HAD GONE SOME LITTLE WAY THEY CAME TO THE BANK OF A RIVER AND THE PRINCE THREW THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER ACROSS TO SERVE AS A BRIDGE AND SO GOT OVER WITH THE CINDER WENCH
TO COMPLETE THE RESEMBLANCE HER FLOCK OF SHEEP APPEARED GRAZING ROUND HER AND SHE FOUND A GAY CROOK ADORNED WITH FLOWERS UPON THE BANK OF THE RIVER
SO SHE TOOK OUT THE FLASK WITH THE SLEEPING DRINK AND PUT IT TO THE LIPS OF THE FIRST OF THEM
WHAT WILL YOU BE CALLED ASKED THE ELDER
OFF WITH YOU MADAM GRASSHOPPER AND THE PRINCESS REJOICING TO FIND HERSELF FREE ONCE MORE SKIPPED OUT INTO THE GARDEN THE PRETTIEST LITTLE GREEN GRASSHOPPER IN THE WORLD
AND BRYNHILD WENT TO HER FATHER AND SAID THAT A KING HAD COME CALLED GUNNAR AND HAD RIDDEN THE FIRE AND SHE MUST MARRY HIM
AND NOW THE YOUTH RODE ONWARDS FOR A LONG LONG TIME OVER HILL AND DALE OVER ROCKY PLACES AND MORASSES AND THEN DAPPLEGRIM BEGAN TO LISTEN AGAIN AND ASKED THE YOUTH IF HE HEARD ANYTHING NOW
HITHER COMES OUR BROTHER DEAR THE PRINCESS OLGA IMMEDIATELY RAN TO MEET HIM AND BEGAN KISSING HIM AND EMBRACING HIM ASKING AFTER HIS HEALTH AND TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT HERSELF
CAN YOU TAKE US CAN YOU TAKE US TO THE KINGDOM OF THE PEACOCKS BUT HE ANSWERED
SO AT LAST SHE YIELDED TO HIS WISHES
XV WILL SOME ONE BE KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME THE MEANING OF ALL THIS CRIED THE LORD OF AVESNES
YOU THOUGHT TO FIND YOUR LADY LOVE BUT THE PRETTY BIRD HAS FLOWN AND ITS SONG IS DUMB
BUT STILL SHE COULD NOT QUITE MAKE UP HER MIND TO GO WITH HIM AND LEAVE HER FATHER'S KINGDOM FOR EVER
IT WAS WORTH YOUR WHILE MADAM SAYS THE HEN-WIFE TO PAY ME WELL FOR IT FOR THE REASON I PRAYED SO ON YOU CONCERNS YOU MUCH WHAT MUST I PAY YOU ASKED THE QUEEN
DOWN FELL THE STONE AND BROKE IN PIECES
I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER MY GRANDMOTHER WHO IS VERY HELPLESS COME TO THE CASTLE I TELL YOU
GOOD-EVENING TO YOU SAID THE OLD WOMAN
GOOD-EVENING TO YOU SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THEN GUDRUN WAS VERY ANGRY AND SAID THAT IT WAS SIGURD NOT GUNNAR WHO HAD RIDDEN THE FLAME AND HAD RECEIVED FROM BRYNHILD THAT FATAL RING THE RING OF THE DWARF ANDVARI
NONSENSE
BUT SHE HAS BEEN BEWITCHED BY A WICKED SORCERESS AND WILL NOT REGAIN HER BEAUTY UNTIL SHE IS MY WIFE DOES SHE SAY SO
WHAT IS THIS I HEAR
I TOOK AND RAISED UP THE MAN WHICH I HAD KILLED AS IF HE WAS STANDING ON HIS FEET AND I CROUCHING BEHIND HIM BORE HIM UP AS WELL AS I COULD SO THAT THE GUARDS READILY SAW HIM AS THEY CAME UP TO THE VAULT
AND NOW WHEN I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD GIVE YOU ONE OF THE PRINCESSES AND ONE OF THE HALVES OF THE KINGDOM DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO GIVE ME SUCH A BLOW WHEN KING PIPPIN HEARD THAT HE BEGGED HIS BROTHER'S PARDON AND THEY WERE RECONCILED AT ONCE AND BECAME GOOD FRIENDS
THEN SHE THREW THE SPINDLE INTO THE WELL AND JUMPED IN HERSELF AFTER IT
THIS COUNTESS WAS ADORED AS MUCH AS THE COUNT WAS HATED
WHEN HE HAD WALKED ALL DAY HE TOO CAME TO THE KING'S PALACE AND THE KING WAS STANDING OUTSIDE ON THE STEPS AND ASKED WHERE HE WAS GOING
A SLICE OFF HER HEEL AND A SLICE OFF HER TOES KARI WOODENGOWN'S SHOE FILLS WITH BLOOD AS SHE GOES AND WHEN THEY LOOKED TO IT THE BIRD HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH FOR BLOOD WAS TRICKLING OUT OF THE SHOE
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STEAL MY HORSE FROM UNDER ME WHEN I AM OUT RIDING ON IT SAID HE
DO PLEASE KEEP ON BARKING FOR FEAR THE SOLES SHOULD COME AND EAT US UP NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THEY HAD FLOATED CLOSE IN TO THE SHORE WHERE A POOR OLD MAN LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE COTTAGE
BUT PRINCE IVAN SAT DOWN ON A STONE AND BURST INTO TEARS
I DO NOT SELL MY SILENCE ANSWERED MICHAEL AND HE WENT AWAY WITHOUT PICKING UP THE PURSE
AND THEY EACH OF THEM LAID THESE TOKENS BEFORE THE KING
AND THE PRINCE SAID TO HIM
XIII IT WAS AGREED THAT THE QUESTION SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE OTHER TEN SISTERS
II ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING THE COUNT PASSED THROUGH A FOREST AND AT THE DOOR OF A LONELY COTTAGE HE SAW A BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPINNING HEMP
NOW MY MERRY LITTLE FRIEND SAID THE MUSICIAN RUN TWENTY TIMES ROUND THE TREE THE LITTLE HARE OBEYED AND WHEN IT HAD RUN TWENTY TIMES ROUND THE TREE THE CORD HAD TWISTED ITSELF TWENTY TIMES ROUND THE TRUNK SO THAT THE POOR LITTLE BEAST WAS HELD A FAST PRISONER AND IT MIGHT BITE AND TEAR AS MUCH AS IT LIKED IT COULDN'T FREE ITSELF AND THE CORD ONLY CUT ITS TENDER NECK
SO THE KING ASKED HER AGAIN WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND THIS TIME SHE ANSWERED THAT IN EATING HER PORRIDGE TOO HASTILY SHE HAD SWALLOWED HER WEDDING-RING
HE SAID IF THERE IS NO DINNER I CANNOT DINE BUT TAKE CARE THAT PLENTY OF THINGS ARE ROASTED FOR SUPPER WHEN EVENING CAME THE PRINCESS SAID TO FRISK
OH NO THEN SHE SAID
YOU ARE PLEASED TO JEST ABOUT HAVING OUR HEADS CUT OFF
HE SENT FORTH MESSENGERS TO ALL PARTS OF THE KINGDOM TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND PUBLISHED HIS LOSS IN ALL THE PARISH CHURCHES BUT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF THEM
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE BEGAN TO ASK ABOUT FARMER WEATHERBEARD
THEN HE TOOK THE TROLL'S LUNGS AND TONGUE AND PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF AND LED THE PRINCESS BACK TO THE KING'S PALACE
SO THE TROLL TOOK HIM UP AND FLUNG HIM AGAINST THE WALL AND THIS MADE THE FLASK OF OINTMENT FALL DOWN AND IT SPLASHED ALL OVER HIM AND HE BECAME AS STRONG AS EVER AGAIN
I WISH YOU'D TEACH ME HOW IT'S DONE THAT'S EASILY LEARNED ANSWERED THE FIDDLER
BUT PERCINET ADVISED HER STILL TO PRETEND TO BE ILL FOR A FEW DAYS AND AFTER PROMISING TO COME TO HER AID WHENEVER SHE NEEDED HIM HE DISAPPEARED AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD COME
AT LAST ONE DAY AT SUNSET DESIRE FELT THE SUN SO WARM THAT HE THOUGHT HE MUST NOW BE NEAR THE PLACE OF HIS DREAM
VERY SOON SHE HAD SPUN THE FIRST SHIFT WHICH WAS FOR HER OWN WEDDING
BUT INDEED I AM LAME FOR THE WANT OF MY TOE EVER SINCE MY LORD AND MASTER SAYS AN OLD WOMAN THAT WAS LISTENING ALL THE TIME THAT STORY IS BUT TOO TRUE AS I WELL KNOW FOR I AM THE VERY WOMAN THAT WAS IN THE GIANT'S CASTLE AND YOU MY LORD THE CHILD THAT I WAS TO MAKE INTO A PIE
SO WHAT MUST BE MUST THEN EVERYTHING WAS MADE READY FOR THE WEDDING WITH GREAT SPLENDOUR AND PROMPTITUDE AND THE YOUTH RODE TO CHURCH ON DAPPLEGRIM AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER ON THE OTHER HORSE
BY WHAT MEANS HAS GOD BROUGHT YOU BACK TO LIFE THUS AND THUS SAYS HE
THEN THEY ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS DOING IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER IN HER THIN DRESS
THOU SHALT HAVE MY THANKS FOR SETTING MY PRINCESS FREE HE SAID WHEN THE YOUTH CAME INTO THE PALACE WITH HER AND WAS THEN ABOUT TO GO AWAY
JUST GO YOUR OWN WAY WILL YOU NOT LONG AFTER HIS PUNISHMENT OVERTOOK HIM FOR NO SOONER HAD HE STRUCK A COUPLE OF BLOWS ON A TREE WITH HIS AXE THAN HE CUT HIS LEG SO BADLY THAT HE HAD TO BE CARRIED HOME
I PRAY HEAVEN WENT ON THE CANARY THAT IT WILL SEND YOU TO SLEEP AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND THE SCULLION FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WHEN THE MASTER COOK CAME BACK HE FOUND THE GOOSE AS BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY
NOW THERE WAS AT THAT TIME A DWARF CALLED ANDVARI WHO LIVED IN A POOL BENEATH A WATERFALL AND THERE HE HAD HIDDEN A GREAT HOARD OF GOLD
I CANNOT ABIDE WITH YOU
YES A BIRD FLEW OVER THE ROOF WITH A CHRISTIAN MAN'S BONE IN HIS BILL AND LET IT FALL DOWN OUR CHIMNEY ANSWERED THE PRINCESS
AND THE STRANGER WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THEM
DEPEND UPON IT SOME MAGIC OR WITCHCRAFT HAS BEEN AT WORK
YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE IT ALONE
OPEN THE DOOR I SAY CRIED THE KING AGAIN
PRESENTLY HE ESPIED A HORSE WITH RICH TRAPPINGS AND IT SAID TO HIM
IT IS NO USE EVEN TO THINK OF THAT
IS THERE NO WAY OF CHANGING THE REINDEER INTO A HUMAN BEING AGAIN I DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW WAS HER ANSWER
TO-DAY IS THE LAST DAY OF THE RESPITE GRANTED TO THOSE IMPOSTORS
AT LAST I'VE GOT A PROPER SORT OF COMPANION SAID THE MUSICIAN FOR IT WAS A HUMAN BEING I WANTED ALL ALONG AND NOT A WILD ANIMAL AND HE BEGAN PLAYING SO ENCHANTINGLY THAT THE POOR MAN STOOD THERE AS IF BEWITCHED AND HIS HEART LEAPT FOR JOY AS HE LISTENED
THE KING AS HE HAD HAD NO DINNER WAS VERY HUNGRY AND WANTED HIS SUPPER EARLY BUT WHEN HE ASKED FOR IT LO AND BEHOLD IT WAS ALL GONE AND HE HAD TO GO TO BED HALF-STARVED AND IN A TERRIBLE TEMPER
AND NOW SAID HE WE ARE TRAVELLING AND DO NOT KNOW WHETHER WE ARE ON THE RIGHT ROAD OR NOT AH
KARI TOOK UP THE SHOE PUT HER FOOT INTO IT AS EASILY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN THREW OFF HER WOODEN GOWN AND THERE SHE STOOD IN THE GOLDEN GOWN WHICH FLASHED LIKE RAYS OF SUNSHINE AND ON HER OTHER FOOT SHE HAD THE FELLOW TO THE GOLD SHOE
DID NOT I TELL YOU THAT I WAS QUITE SURE THAT THAT CREATURE WHO WOOED AND WON YOU AS HIS WIFE HAD NOT BEEN BORN A PIG
NEXT MORNING THE HUNT BEGAN AGAIN AND AS SOON AS THE LITTLE ROE HEARD THE HORNS AND THE HO
AND THE NEXT WAS HIMSELF REGIN AND HE WAS A GREAT SMITH AND MAKER OF SWORDS
AND NOW THE YOUNG KING WAS DEEPLY AFFLICTED AND DAY OUT AND DAY IN WENT ABOUT THINKING OF NAUGHT ELSE BUT HOW TO GET BACK AGAIN TO HIS QUEEN
HE WOULD GLADLY ACCOMPANY THEM FOR SOME PART OF THEIR WAY HE SAID AND THAT HE DID
BUT WHEN SHE SAW HER RING SHE WAS HEARTILY GLAD AND THEN THE RIGHTFUL WEDDING WAS HELD AND HELD IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS TALKED ABOUT FAR AND WIDE.(12 12 FROM J
HE LOST NO TIME IN OPENING IT BUT WHAT WAS HIS HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED A MAN'S HAND WHICH WAS HOLDING A PORTRAIT
THEN THE YOUNGEST SISTER DECLARED THAT IF THEY LAID A FINGER ON THE LITTLE GARDEN BOY SHE WOULD HERSELF GO AND TELL THEIR FATHER THE SECRET OF THE HOLES IN THEIR SHOES
SHE WAS ALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A THICK FOREST
BEFORE THE PRINCESS LEFT THE MOTHER OF THE SUN GAVE HER A ROAST CHICKEN TO EAT AND ADVISED HER TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE BONES WHICH SHE DID WRAPPING THEM UP IN A BUNDLE
PRINCE PEERLESS HASTENED AFTER HER AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED BUT COULD NOT GET ANY NEARER
SO THEY SEARCHED TILL THEY FOUND THE POISONOUS COMB AND THE MOMENT THEY PULLED IT OUT OF HER HEAD SNOWDROP CAME TO HERSELF AGAIN AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY DEAD BODIES LYING OUTSIDE THE DOOR BUT YOU MUST NOT CONCERN YOURSELF ABOUT THEM
BUT THE ELDER WHO WAS BIGGER AND STRONGER PUSHED HER SISTER ASIDE AND THREW HER ARMS ROUND KING PIPPIN'S NECK AND KISSED HIM
THE OLD HAG GAVE HIM THE SWORD SO SHE GOT HER EYE BACK
AND WHILE SHE WAS HERE THE PRINCESS HAD A LITTLE BABY
SHE CAN EASILY SEE IT FOR SHE SHINES ON ALL THINGS SO WHEN THE MOON STOOD CLEAR AND BRIGHT ABOVE THE TREE-TOPS THE OLD WOMAN WENT OUT
THEN THE WITCH GAVE HIM THE CHILD SAYING
SHE WAS SO TERRIFIED LEST SHE SHOULD BREAK ANYTHING OFF THAT SHE SAT AND TWISTED AND TURNED HERSELF ON THIS SIDE AND ON THAT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE BRANCHES AND PUSHED THEM AWAY FROM HER WITH HER HANDS BUT EVERY MOMENT THEY STRUCK AGAINST HER EYES SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE WHAT SHE WAS CLUTCHING AT AND BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE HAD A GOLDEN APPLE IN HER HANDS
YOU MAY WALK IN THE GARDEN AND YOU MAY GO INTO ALL THE ROOMS IN THE PALACE EXCEPT THE ROOM AT THE BACK IN THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER
THEY BIT AND THEY FOUGHT WITH THEIR FORE LEGS AND THEIR HIND LEGS AND SOMETIMES THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THEM
HE READILY CONSENTED TO HER DESIRE AND HIS SONS WERE SENT FOR TO THE TOWER WHO GLADLY CAME TO COURT REJOICING THAT THEY WERE FREED FROM SUCH CONFINEMENT
AND AFTER ALL WHO KNOWS THIS IDEA PUT SOME LIFE INTO HIM
HE ARRIVED THUS AT THE CAPITAL AND THREADED HIS WAY STRAIGHT UP THE HIGH STREET STILL RUNNING AND SINGING QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE GOOD FOLKS TILL HE CAME TO THE KING'S PALACE
WE MUST BEWARE OF HIM THE TOWN COUNSELLOR WHO WAS CONSIDERED CLEVER REASSURED THEM
WELL SHE SAID TO HER WITHOUT MY LITTLE HOOD WHERE WOULD YOU BE NOW DARLING AND TO RESTORE HEART AND LEGS TO THE CHILD SHE MADE HER EAT A GOOD PIECE OF HER CAKE AND DRINK A GOOD DRAUGHT OF WINE AFTER WHICH SHE TOOK HER BY THE HAND AND LED HER BACK TO THE HOUSE
TRULY YOU ARE NO MAID BUT A KING'S DAUGHTER SO HE TREATED HER ROYALLY AND AS TIME WENT ON SHE HAD A SON CALLED SIGURD A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND VERY STRONG
THE PRINCE HAD TO TAKE THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER FOR HIS BRIDE WHETHER HE WOULD OR NO
AT THIS MOMENT A HUGE EAGLE FLEW INTO THE ROOM HOLDING IN ITS TALONS A GOLDEN BRANCH UPON WHICH WERE GROWING WHAT LOOKED LIKE CLUSTERS OF CHERRIES ONLY EVERY CHERRY WAS A SINGLE GLOWING RUBY
THE KING WAS VERY UNWILLING TO PERMIT IT BUT AT LAST THE LAD GOT LEAVE
BUT IT WAS SO THICKLY WOODED THAT IT WAS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET FORWARD AND DO WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE SOMEHOW OR OTHER TORE OFF A LEAF WHICH GOT INTO HER HAND
IT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD HER ALTOGETHER BUT SHE PEEPED OUT AND HER PRETTY HEAD WAS REFLECTED IN THE CLEAR WATER
AND AT THIS MOMENT A VOICE IN HER EAR SAID SOFTLY
JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE GRANDMOTHER ARRIVES RETURNING FROM THE TOWN WITH HER LONG SACK EMPTY ON HER SHOULDER
THAT NIGHT WHEN THE QUEEN CAME SHE SAID
MICHAEL FOLLOWED THEM AND WAITED BEHIND THE OPEN DOOR TILL THEY GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR DEPARTURE
THE ENCHANTED PIG ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
BUT JUST GO ALONG THE SIDE OF THE HILL AND YOU WILL COME TO SOME GIRLS WHO ARE STANDING THERE WASHING CLOTHES AND THEN YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WALK FAR BEFORE YOU ARE AT SORIA MORIA CASTLE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HALVOR CAME TO THE GIRLS WHO WERE STANDING WASHING AND THEY ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF THE WEST WIND WHO WAS TO COME THERE TO DRY THE CLOTHES FOR THE WEDDING
HER SKIN WAS LIKE A SHARK'S HER ARMS WERE THIN AS LATHS AND HER FINGERS LIKE SPINDLES
THEY OPENED BOXES AND CHESTS OF WHICH THE KEYS HAD BEEN LOST FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND FOUND NUMBERS OF CURIOUS THINGS BUT NOT THE DAGGER AND THE KING TORE HIS BEARD AND THE QUEEN TORE HER HAIR FOR THE HANDKERCHIEF AND THE DAGGER WERE THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS IN THE KINGDOM
THE PRINCESS STOOD QUITE STILL AT FIRST FROM SHEER BEWILDERMENT BUT WHEN THE LAST SOUND OF THE RETREATING CARRIAGES DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE SHE BEGAN TO RUN AIMLESSLY HITHER AND THITHER SOMETIMES KNOCKING HERSELF AGAINST A TREE SOMETIMES TRIPPING OVER A STONE FEARING EVERY MINUTE THAT SHE WOULD BE EATEN UP BY THE LIONS
WE CAN'T HIDE HER AWAY IN THE BLACK GROUND SO THEY HAD A COFFIN MADE OF TRANSPARENT GLASS AND THEY LAID HER IN IT AND WROTE ON THE LID IN GOLDEN LETTERS THAT SHE WAS A ROYAL PRINCESS
BUT THE WITCH KINDLED A FIRE ON THE HEARTH THREW A POTFUL OF BARLEYCORNS AMONG THE CINDERS AND SAID TO THE GIRL
WE SHALL HAVE A TUSSLE FOR THAT SHRIEKED THE TROLL
HOW NOW
THEN A SUDDEN RUSHING SOUND WAS HEARD IN THE AIR AND TWELVE RAVENS WERE SEEN FLYING OVERHEAD
HE WAS ALWAYS GOING ABOUT GRUMBLING AND GROWLING AND SAYING THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE MIGHT BE SUCH A THING AS HAVING TOO MANY OF THESE GOOD GIFTS
I CANNOT STAY HERE ANY LONGER
THE KING'S FIRST ACT ON REACHING HOME WAS TO THANK HEAVEN FOR THE VICTORY HE HAD GAINED OVER THE ENEMIES WHO HAD RISEN AGAINST HIM
WHEN HER STEPMOTHER HEARD OF HER GOOD FORTUNE SHE CAME TO THE PALACE WITH HER DAUGHTER BY WAY OF PAYING A CALL AND TOOK UP HER ABODE THERE
YOU MIGHT FREEZE TO DEATH THE GIRL HOWEVER LEFT HER NO PEACE SO SHE WAS FORCED AT LAST TO GIVE IN BUT SHE INSISTED ON HER PUTTING ON A BEAUTIFUL FUR CLOAK AND SHE GAVE HER BREAD AND BUTTER AND CAKES TO EAT ON THE WAY
HOWEVER THERE ARE TWELVE MARES UPON THE HILLS WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET DIVIDED AMONG US AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM FOR YOUR SHARE YOU MAY TAKE THEM SO THE YOUTH WELL PLEASED WITH THIS THANKED THEM AND AT ONCE SET OFF TO THE HILL WHERE THE TWELVE MARES WERE AT PASTURE
BUT WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY THE YOUNGEST BROTHER SAID TO THE OTHERS
HE HAD NO PROPERTY TO BEQUEATH TO THEM AND NO MEANS OF PUTTING THEM IN THE WAY OF GETTING A LIVING AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO HE SAID THAT THEY HAD HIS LEAVE TO TAKE TO ANYTHING THEY MOST FANCIED AND GO TO ANY PLACE THEY BEST LIKED
THE NEXT MORNING AT NINE O'CLOCK THE BAGPIPER REPAIRED TO THE TOWN HALL WHERE THE TOWN COUNCIL AWAITED HIM
YOU MUST GO AWAY FOR I MAY NOT LET ANYONE IN BUT SURELY YOU ARE NOT FORBIDDEN TO LOOK OUT SAID THE OLD WOMAN AND SHE HELD UP THE POISONOUS COMB FOR HER TO SEE
THEY ALL PRETENDED TO BELIEVE IT AND THE LADIES AT ONCE PUT ON THE FALSE PRINCESS THE RICH DRESSES THEY HAD BROUGHT FOR ZIZI
AND LEFT FILE
HOW I WISH SAID THE FAIRY THAT I DARED TO TELL YOU WHAT IS IN STORE FOR YOU AND WARN YOU OF THE TRAPS WHICH LIE IN YOUR PATH BUT I MUST NOT
SO THIS TIME HE ALLOWED HER TO GO INTO IT AND SHE PEERED ABOUT HIGH AND LOW BUT SHE COULD NOT LOOK UNDER HIS HOOFS FOR HE STOOD MUCH TOO FIRMLY ON HIS LEGS FOR THAT AND SHE COULD NOT FIND THE YOUTH
I HAD NOT GONE FAR CONTINUED THE THIEF OF SLOAN UNTIL I SAW A GREY-HOUND A HARE AND A HAWK IN PURSUIT OF ME AND BEGAN TO THINK IT MUST BE THE WITCHES THAT HAD TAKEN THE SHAPES IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT NOT ESCAPE THEM UNSEEN EITHER BY LAND OR WATER
THE FRAMEWORK WAS ALL SPARKLING WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES AND THE STRINGS WERE ALL OF GOLD
SO THEY ATTIRED SIGURD IN ALL HIS GOLDEN ARMOUR AND BUILT A GREAT PILE OF WOOD ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND AT NIGHT LAID ON IT THE DEAD SIGURD AND THE DEAD BRYNHILD AND THE GOOD HORSE GRANI AND SET FIRE TO IT AND LAUNCHED THE SHIP
IT IS WELL FOR YOU SAYS THE YOUNG WOMAN THAT THE LORD OF THIS CASTLE IS NOT AT HOME AT PRESENT
YOU KNOW WHAT PRICE MY FATHER HAS PROMISED TO PAY FOR OUR SECRET I KNOW PRINCESS ANSWERED MICHAEL
HE RODE HOME BUT HE WAS SO HAUNTED BY THE SONG HE HAD HEARD THAT HE RETURNED EVERY DAY TO THE WOOD AND LISTENED
NO SIRE REPLIED THE PRINCE
WHO IS THAT WHO IS TOUCHING MY WOOD HE SAID
BUT THOUGH THE GOOD LITTLE MOUSE DID HER VERY UTMOST THEY COULD NOT FIND OUT WHERE CANCALINE HAD HIDDEN THE LITTLE PRINCESS
HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU REALLY WERE SO SICK AT HEART THAT YOU HANGED YOURSELF THERE OR IF IT IS ONLY A HOBGOBLIN THAT'S BEFORE ME SAID THE MAN
AY AY
BUT HIS SURPRISE WAS GREAT TO FIND THAT THEY REPRESENTED THE SAME SCENES AS THE WINDOWS OF THE GALLERY AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE ALIVE
THEN SHE TRIED ALL THE OTHERS IN TURN BUT ONE WAS TOO LONG AND ANOTHER TOO SHORT AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN SHE GOT TO THE SEVENTH THAT SHE FOUND ONE TO SUIT HER EXACTLY
THE QUEEN MORE JEALOUS WITH THEM THAN EVER THOUGHT IT AN AGE UNTIL ALL THE FEASTING AND REJOICING WAS OVER THAT SHE MIGHT GET MAKING HER PROPOSAL DEPENDING GREATLY ON THE POWER OF THE HEN-WIFE'S CARDS
RENELDE FELT AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK BUT SHE HELD FIRM
SO THE MAN PLUCKED OUT ANOTHER AND THEN FARMER WEATHERBEARD SHRIEKED OOF AGAIN
SO THE LAZY GIRL CAME HOME ALL COVERED WITH PITCH AND WHEN THE OLD HEN ON THE TOP OF THE WALL SAW HER IT CALLED OUT
SO THE KING ASKED WHERE WHITELAND WAS
EVERY TIME SHE OPENS HER MOUTH A PIECE OF GOLD SHALL FALL OUT AND THE THIRD
MIRROR MIRROR HANGING THERE WHO IN ALL THE LAND'S MOST FAIR IT ALWAYS REPLIED
PRESENTLY A FOX SLUNK THROUGH THE TREES
SHE TOLD HIM THAT HER BROTHER WAS AT THAT TIME ASLEEP ON THE BLUE SEA AND SHE GAVE HIM A SWORD OF STEEL AND A DRAUGHT OF THE WATER OF STRENGTH AND SHE TOLD HIM TO CUT OFF HER BROTHER'S HEAD AT A SINGLE STROKE
A WHOLE YEAR GOES BY
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT OBSTINATE PRINCE
SO THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A GOOD BIT FARTHER
BY-AND-BY HE HEARD A HEAVY TRAMP ON THE STAIRS LIKE THE LUMBERING ALONG OF A GREAT CANNON AND THEN A VOICE LIKE THUNDER CRIED OUT
UPON THE LONG TABLE TWELVE MICE WERE FASTENED BY THE TAIL AND JUST IN FRONT OF EACH ONE'S NOSE BUT QUITE BEYOND ITS REACH LAY A TEMPTING MORSEL OF FAT BACON
SO THE LAD GOT SUCH SHOES FOR HIS HORSE THAT THE STICKS AND STONES FLEW HIGH UP INTO THE AIR AS HE RODE AWAY OVER THE HILLS AND SUCH A GOLD SADDLE AND SUCH A GOLD BRIDLE THAT THEY COULD BE SEEN GLITTERING AND GLANCING FROM AFAR
SO HE MOUNTED DAPPLEGRIM AND RODE AWAY FROM THE COURT AND WHEN HE HAD RIDDEN FOR A LONG LONG TIME OVER HILLS AND MOORS DAPPLEGRIM ASKED
AND ALL MY GUESTS ARE THEY ASLEEP AND THE SCULLION ANSWERED
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU ALL DOING THAT YOU DON'T COME UPSTAIRS AND THAT YOU LET THE BEER RUN ALL OVER THE CELLAR YES I KNOW MY BOY SAID THE FATHER BUT IF YOU MARRY OUR DAUGHTER WHAT SHALL YOU CALL YOUR CHILDREN
I AM FAR TOO BRAVE FOR THAT
IT HAD NO WINDOWS AND THE DOOR WAS UP IN THE ROOF
WHAT A BRIDE FOR OUR POOR KING
WHO DRINKS OF ME WILL BE A WOLF I WHO DRINKS OF ME WILL BE A WOLF AND SHE CRIED OH
GO STRAIGHT FORWARD INTO A SMALL DARK CHAMBER
MY POOR FATHER
NOW IT WAS NIGHT AND ON THE CREST OF THE HILL SIGURD SAW A RED FIRE BLAZING UP INTO THE SKY AND WITHIN THE FLAME A CASTLE AND A BANNER ON THE TOPMOST TOWER
WHEN MINNIKIN WENT UP TO THE KING'S PALACE HE SAW THAT EVERYTHING THERE WAS HUNG WITH BLACK BOTH OUTSIDE AND INSIDE FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP
NEVER MIND DEAR LITTLE FAWN I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU AND SHE TOOK OFF HER GOLDEN GARTER AND TIED IT ROUND THE ROE'S NECK
BUT IS THERE NOTHING YOU WISH FOR YOURSELF MADAM CRIED THE PRINCE FLINGING HIMSELF DOWN AT HER FEET ONLY LOOK AT MY UGLINESS
NEVER WERE SO MANY BEAUTIFUL PRINCESSES SEEN TOGETHER AT ONE TIME BUT THE ONE WHOM THE COW-BOY THOUGHT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE MOST FASCINATING WAS THE LITTLE PRINCESS WITH THE VELVET EYES
HE SAW THE COFFIN ON THE HILL WITH THE BEAUTIFUL SNOWDROP INSIDE IT AND WHEN HE HAD READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT IN GOLDEN LETTERS HE SAID TO THE DWARF
THEY MAY THREATEN AND FORCE AS THEY WILL HE TURNS FROM HER SHRINKS FROM HER STILL AND IMMEDIATELY THE REINDEER DREW NEAR AND NURSED AND TENDED THE CHILD THE WHOLE DAY LONG
THE STABLE BOYS WERE JUST WATERING THE HORSES FOR THE NIGHT AND IT WAS QUITE AS MUCH AS THEY COULD DO TO ATTEND TO THAT
FOR THIS PURPOSE A GREAT BANQUET WAS GIVEN ON THE FOURTH DAY AND ALL THE PEOPLE WERE INVITED TO THE PALACE
ONE DAY SHE MET THE COUNT
THAT IS WHY I WEEP DEAR LITTLE MOTHER DO NOT WEEP SAID HER MOTHER CONSOLINGLY
SO THEY TRAVELLED ONWARDS AGAIN FOR MANY AND MANY A MILE OVER HILL AND DALE
THE DESIRE GREW DAY BY DAY AND JUST BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET ANY SHE PINED AWAY AND BECAME QUITE PALE AND WRETCHED
AT THIS THE KING WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED FOR HE DID NOT AT ALL WANT TO LOSE ALL THOSE BARRELS OF GOLD AND JEWELS
WHILE HE WAS DOING THIS THE EAGLE FLEW OFF TO THE MAN'S HOME WITH HIM AND WITH THE HARE AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT HOME THE MAN WENT TO THE CHURCHYARD AND HAD SOME CHRISTIAN EARTH LAID UPON THE HARE AND THEN IT TURNED INTO HIS SON JACK
HE CUT HOLES IN THE CORN SACKS SO THAT BARLEY AND RYE RAN OUT ON EVERY SIDE AND ALL THE WILD BIRDS THAT WERE IN THE FOREST CAME IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT THEY DARKENED THE SUN
NOW MY FRIEND HE SAID GIVE ME YOUR RIGHT PAW THIS HE BOUND TO THE OTHER BRANCH AND HAVING CAREFULLY SEEN THAT HIS KNOTS WERE ALL SECURE HE STEPPED OFF THE ENDS OF THE BRANCHES AND THEY SPRANG BACK LEAVING THE POOR FOX SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR
UP HE JUMPED IN A MOMENT AND SET OFF AGAIN IN PURSUIT CAUGHT UP THE BEAST AND AGAIN BEGAN FIGHTING WITH IT
IT SMELLS JUST AS IF THERE WERE CHRISTIAN MAN'S BLOOD HERE YES YOU SHALL LEARN THAT THERE IS SAID HALVOR AND CUT OFF ALL HIS HEADS
HAVE YOU A HORSE TOO SHE SAID WHEN SHE CAME IN AGAIN
ALAS SAID THE PRINCESS IF ONLY I COULD FIND SOMETHING FOR YOU TO EAT I SHOULD NOT MIND BEING HUNGRY MYSELF NO I SHOULD NOT MIND THAT EITHER ANSWERED FANFARONADE
WHEN THEY SAW THE MAN FALL THEY RAN ALL INTO THE VAULT AND NEVER STOPPED UNTIL THEY WERE AT THE END OF IT FOR FEAR AS I THOUGHT THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHERS ALONG WITH HIM THAT WAS KILLED
IF WE FIND HIM FOR YOU WE SHALL BE VERY GLAD
WHEN DRESSING IN THE MORNING THEY FOUND THEM IN THEIR BREECHES AND PETTICOATS IN THEIR POCKETS AND IN THEIR BOOTS
SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A NOISE AMONG THE TREES
I DON'T MEAN TO BE A BEAST OF BURDEN ANY LONGER AND SHE FLUNG THE BUCKET SO HIGH IN THE AIR THAT IT STUCK IN THE BRANCHES OF AN OAK
YOU COULD LIVE IN A COTTAGE AT THE END OF THE PARK AND HELP YOUR HUSBAND TO DRAW UP WATER FROM THE WELL AND WHEN WE GET UP YOU COULD BRING US OUR BOUQUETS THE PRINCESS LINA WAS VERY ANGRY AND WHEN THE STAR GAZER PRESENTED HER BOUQUET SHE RECEIVED IT IN A DISDAINFUL MANNER
FARMER WEATHERBEARD THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO HAD AN ONLY SON AND HE WAS CALLED JACK
AND FAFNIR HAD LIVED IN A CAVE WITH IRON DOORS A CAVE DUG DEEP DOWN IN THE EARTH AND FULL OF GOLD BRACELETS AND CROWNS AND RINGS
THUS JACK TOOK POSSESSION OF THE CASTLE
BUT YOU MUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE TABLE-DRAWER AND TAKE OUT THREE BITS OF BREAD AND IF YOU HEAR ANYONE SNORING PLUCK THREE FEATHERS FROM HIS HEAD
BUT RITTER RED DID NOT CONCERN HIMSELF ABOUT THAT
THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE BALL AND AT THE END OF SUPPER WOULD GIVE HIM THE PHILTRE WHICH WAS TO ENCHANT HIM LIKE THE REST
WHAT A PRETTY FACE SHE EXCLAIMED WHY IT MUST BE MINE
THE ENCHANTED CASTLE HAS NO MORE SECRETS FOR YOU SHE SAID TO THE STAR GAZER
SHE JOYFULLY PICKED ENOUGH TO FILL HER BASKET THANKED THE LITTLE MEN FOR THEIR KINDNESS SHOOK HANDS WITH THEM AND RAN HOME TO BRING HER STEPMOTHER WHAT SHE HAD ASKED FOR
THEY WERE VERY KINDLY TREATED AND THAT THEY MIGHT NOT FEEL DULL THE KING CAME OFTEN TO SEE THEM
ASBJORNSEN
ASBJORNSEN
ASBJORNSEN
ASBJORNSEN
AND FIRST HE ORDERED THEM TO LAY THE CABLE IN THE SHIP BUT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO LIFT IT AND THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR ONE OR TWO MEN AT A TIME IN THE LITTLE BIT OF A SHIP
HE FOUND NO ONE THERE SO HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT SOFTLY FOR HE THOUGHT HE COULD NOT DO SO WITH THE HARP IN HIS HAND
KOSHCHEI DRANK IT UP AND ASKED FOR A THIRD AND WHEN HE HAD SWALLOWED THE THIRD BUCKETFUL HE REGAINED HIS FORMER STRENGTH GAVE HIS CHAINS A SHAKE AND BROKE ALL TWELVE AT ONCE
THROWS HERSELF INTO THE FURNACE WHICH SHE FLOODS WITH ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD LIGHTED IT
ALAS LITTLE CREATURE
THE GOLDEN BRANCH ITSELF HAD BECOME AS TALL AS A FOREST TREE AND SPARKLED WITH RUBY CHERRIES TO ITS TOPMOST TWIG
THE ELDEST PRINCESS OPENED IT AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IMMEDIATELY IN A LOVELY LITTLE WOOD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE SPANGLED WITH DROPS OF SILVER WHICH SHONE IN THE BRILLIANT LIGHT OF THE MOON
YES BUT IF YOU WILL KILL ALL THE OTHER LITTLE FOALS SO THAT I CAN SUCK ALL THE MARES FOR A YEAR YOU SHALL SEE HOW BIG AND HANDSOME I SHALL BE THEN SAID THE FOAL
NOW KOSHCHEI WAS OUT HUNTING
I HAVE EATEN AND I HAVE DRUNK FOR YOU AND NOW I WILL GIVE YOU THE SHIP
AS YOU HAVE NOT EATEN ANYTHING YOU CANNOT BE THIRSTY AH CRIED THE PRINCESS I AM WELL PUNISHED FOR DISAPPOINTING THE KING AND QUEEN AND RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS AMBASSADOR ABOUT WHOM I KNEW NOTHING AND SO SAYING SHE WANDERED AWAY INTO THE THICKEST PART OF THE WOOD AND SAT DOWN UNDER A THORN TREE WHERE A NIGHTINGALE WAS SINGING
WE WOULD GIVE EVERYTHING WE VALUE IN THE WORLD TO TAKE AWAY THE CAUSE OF YOUR SORROW BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE ANOTHER OF THE TRICKS OF THE FAIRY CARABOSSE
THE GOVERNOR SAW IT TOO BUT SAID OH LET IT GO
SO THAT'S THE STAIRCASE IS IT SAID THE PRINCE
YES SAID HALVOR HE HAS ONLY GONE TO BREAK DOWN A BIT OF SPRUCE FIR
WHEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER CAME TO THE CHURCH THE PRIEST AND PEOPLE WERE ALL STANDING ON THE HILLSIDE WAITING FOR HER AND THE PRINCE RAN UP AND WANTED TO HOLD THE HORSE BUT SHE JUMPED OFF SAYING
SO SHE LED A VERY EASY LIFE WAS NEVER SCOLDED AND LIVED ON THE FAT OF THE LAND
HE GOT BOTH THE IRON AND THE STEEL AND THE SMITHS AND THUS WAS DAPPLEGRIM SHOD STRONGLY AND WELL AND WHEN THE YOUTH WENT OUT OF THE KING'S PALACE A CLOUD OF DUST ROSE UP BEHIND HIM
SO AGAIN THEY WANTED TO GO OUT AND CATCH IT BUT THE GOVERNOR AGAIN TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS OF NO USE TO TRY
IT MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN ONE'S IDEAS TO BE DYING OF HUNGER AND THIRST ON A DESERT ISLAND AT THIS THE PRINCESS WAS DREADFULLY VEXED AND SHE SAT DOWN UNDER A WHITE ROSE BUSH AND BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF SUCH FELLOWS WELL BUT AS I HAVE COME HERE YOU MIGHT JUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT SAID CINDERLAD
JACK MADE ANOTHER JOURNEY UP THE BEANSTALK TO THE GIANT'S CASTLE ONE DAY WHILE HIS MOTHER HAD GONE TO MARKET
THERE WERE LIONS BEARS WOLVES STAGS HORSES BUFFALOES EAGLES AND PEACOCKS
HE MUST BE MAD
WHEN MINNIKIN HAD WALKED A LONG WAY ALONE HE MET AN OLD OLD CROOK-BACKED HAG WHO HAD ONLY ONE EYE
THAT IS HOW HE MAY BE SEEN TO THIS DAY PAINTED ON A WINDOW OF THE CATHEDRAL OF HAMEL
THE PRINCESS AND FANFARONADE ON LANDING UPON THE ISLAND HAD GIVEN THE BOATMAN A HUNDRED GOLD PIECES AND MADE HIM PROMISE SOLEMNLY TO TELL NO ONE WHERE HE HAD TAKEN THEM
WHEN HE CAME TO HIS SENSES IT WAS TOO LATE
THE UNKNOWN KNIGHT THEN SALUTED HER GRACEFULLY AND RETIRED WITHOUT TELLING HIS NAME TO ANYBODY
THEN THE GUARDS BEGAN TO SEARCH THE POULTRY-YARD AND COULD FIND NOBODY THERE BUT DELICIA WHO WITH HER SPLENDID DRESS AND HER CROWN OF DIAMONDS LOOKED SUCH A LOVELY PRINCESS THAT THEY HARDLY DARED TO SPEAK TO HER
THEN SHE SHUT THE DOOR AND THE GIRL FOUND HERSELF BACK IN THE WORLD AGAIN NOT FAR FROM HER OWN HOUSE
HEY
IT ALMOST BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF ALL YOU HAVE SUFFERED AND I ONLY WISH I HAD KNOWN IT SOONER AS I SHOULD HAVE COME TO YOUR RESCUE AT ONCE WHEN THE OLD WITCH HAD GONE AWAY THE PRINCESS HID THE THREAD VERY CAREFULLY AND AT NIGHT SHE GOT UP QUIETLY AND WITH A BEATING HEART SHE BOUND THE THREAD ROUND HER HUSBAND'S FOOT
IN ORDER TO MAKE HER SPINDLE BLOODY SHE STUCK HER HAND INTO A HEDGE OF THORNS AND PRICKED HER FINGER
THERE IS NOWHERE ON EARTH SO BEAUTIFUL A WOMAN AS THIS SAID THE KING
THOU WHO ART IN MY HOUSE NAME THYSELF
WHITELAND ANSWERED THE MAN AND THEN HE BEGGED THE YOUTH TO TELL HIM WHENCE HE CAME AND WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AND THE YOUTH DID SO
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF DEAR CHILD
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THREE MONTHS THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL SLEPT QUIETLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
HE HAD THE GIANTESS BURIED AND ENDEAVOURED AS MUCH AS LAY IN HIS POWER TO DO RIGHT TO THOSE WHOM THE GIANT HAD ROBBED
STAY WHERE YOU ARE UNLESS YOU WISH TO DIE BUT DON'T YOU HEAR THAT VOICE CALLING ME SHE ANSWERED
AT THIS STORY THE PARENTS REDOUBLED THEIR LAMENTATIONS
MASTER AND THE GIANT WOKE UP
YOU MUST KILL HER AND BRING ME BACK HER LUNGS AND LIVER THAT I MAY KNOW FOR CERTAIN SHE IS DEAD THE HUNTSMAN DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND LED SNOWDROP OUT INTO THE WOOD BUT AS HE WAS IN THE ACT OF DRAWING OUT HIS KNIFE TO SLAY HER SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID
TAKE CARE WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT FOR IF YOU AGAIN REFUSE TO MARRY ME SHE SHALL BE TORN IN PIECES BY TWO TIGERS THE PRINCE WAS DISTRACTED FOR HE FANCIED HE HEARD HIS DEAR SHEPHERDESS WEEPING AND BEGGING HIM TO SAVE HER
EVERY MORNING THE DWARFS WENT INTO THE MOUNTAIN TO DIG FOR GOLD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY RETURNED HOME SNOWDROP ALWAYS HAD THEIR SUPPER READY FOR THEM
BUT THOUGH HE RUBBED HIS EYES AND DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO KEEP HIMSELF AWAKE IT WAS ALL IN VAIN FOR THE BUSHY BRIDE CROONED AND SANG TILL HIS EYES WERE FAST CLOSED AND WHEN THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG MAIDEN CAME HE WAS SOUND ASLEEP AND SNORING
YOU MAY NOT REGRET ME PRINCESS HE SAID SADLY FOR I FEAR THAT YOU DO NOT LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH
HER HUSBAND AWOKE WITH A START AND SAID TO HER UNHAPPY WOMAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
GIVE ME THE PRINCESS ANNA TO WIFE I WON'T INTERFERE WITH MY SISTER'S FREEDOM
HE THREW DOWN THE THREE LITTLE BITS OF BREAD AND A HARE CAME OUT AND ATE THEM
D'AULNOY
D'AULNOY
THEN THE POOR DWARF WAS VERY ANGRY AND HE PRAYED THAT THE GOLD MIGHT NEVER BRING ANY BUT BAD LUCK TO ALL THE MEN WHO MIGHT OWN IT FOR EVER
SHE GATHERED HERBS TO COOK THE VEGETABLES IN FETCHED THE WOOD AND WATCHED THE POTS ON THE FIRE AND ALWAYS WHEN HER ELEVEN BROTHERS RETURNED SHE HAD THEIR SUPPER READY FOR THEM
OUTWARDLY IT LOOKED BEAUTIFUL WHITE WITH RED CHEEKS SO THAT EVERYONE WHO SAW IT LONGED TO EAT IT BUT ANYONE WHO MIGHT DO SO WOULD CERTAINLY DIE ON THE SPOT
AT LAST HOWEVER HE TOOK A FANCY TO GO HOME FOR A SHORT TIME TO SEE HIS PARENTS
I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU
HELP HELP US NOW IMMEDIATELY A SOFT VOICE SAID IN HIS EAR
NOW THE CROWS ARE CLOSE BEHIND US SAID THE MAN
MY DEAR CHILDREN I AM OBLIGED TO GO TO THE WARS
THEN THE GOOD FAIRY RAN TO TELL THE QUEEN AND THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE BLACK DUNGEON WHERE DELICIA WAS IMPRISONED
GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I AM DYING OF THIRST SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD
I HAVE ORDERED THAT SHE SHALL BE BURIED AT ONCE AND THEN THE PRINCESS SAW HOW SHE DRESSED UP A LOG OF WOOD AND HAD IT BURIED AND HOW THE OLD KING CRIED AND ALL THE PEOPLE MURMURED THAT THE QUEEN HAD KILLED GRACIOSA WITH HER CRUELTIES AND THAT SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER HEAD CUT OFF
THEN SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE BEGAN TO DANCE AND THUS THE MAN GOT LEAVE TO STAY THE NIGHT THERE
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT YOU WILL SOON OVERTAKE HER THE PRINCE THANKED HER HEARTILY AND SET OUT
THEY WERE SEVEN DWARFS WHO WORKED IN THE MINES RIGHT DOWN DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN
AND IS IT OF YOUR FREE WILL OR AGAINST YOUR WILL PRINCE IVAN REPLIED NOT AGAINST THEIR WILL DO BRAVE YOUTHS RIDE WELL IF YOUR BUSINESS BE NOT PRESSING TARRY AWHILE IN MY TENT THEREAT WAS PRINCE IVAN GLAD
SHE IS LIVING LIKE A REINDEER IN THE WOOD
FOR THIS CAUSE HE WAS CONTINUALLY WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THINKING HOW HE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET HER AND YET DO NOTHING THAT WAS UNKIND TO HER SISTER
HOW UGLY SHE IS AND HE FANCIED THEY MUST REFER TO SOME DWARF THE PRINCESS WAS BRINGING WITH HER
HERE THEY SAID LET US TAKE UP OUR ABODE AND YOU BENJAMIN YOU ARE THE YOUNGEST AND WEAKEST YOU SHALL STAY AT HOME AND KEEP HOUSE FOR US
BRING HIM HERE AND I'LL CUT HIS THROAT
NECESSITY ALONE DROVE ME TO THE DEED
OF FOOD SHE GOT LITTLE OR NONE AND GREW PALE AND THIN AND WAS NEARLY ALWAYS WEEPING AND SAD
WHAT A SMELL OF CHRISTIAN BLOOD THERE IS HERE SAID HE
DON'T LET US WASTE TIME
ACCORDINGLY THAT VERY NIGHT I SET ABOUT IT AND COMING TO THE PLACE I UNDERSTOOD HE WAS PLACED AT THE FURTHER END OF A LONG DARK VAULT WHICH I SLOWLY ENTERED
HE IS IN THE YARD WHERE HE BEGINS TO SING LOUDER THAN EVER
HE STOOD ON THE STAIRS AND WHEN THE NORTH WIND CAME HOWLING AND ROARING AND CAUGHT THE ROOF AND WALLS OF THE CASTLE TILL THEY SHOOK AGAIN THE PRINCE WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER
ONE DAY IT HAPPENED THAT THE ELDEST SON WISHED TO GO INTO THE FOREST TO CUT WOOD AND BEFORE HE STARTED HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM A FINE RICH CAKE AND A BOTTLE OF WINE SO THAT HE MIGHT BE SURE NOT TO SUFFER FROM HUNGER OR THIRST
WHILE THE GOOSE WAS TURNING ON THE SPIT A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CANARY HOPPED ON TO THE SILL OF THE OPEN WINDOW
JACK FELT A LITTLE TIRED AND THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT HE WOULD GO BACK AGAIN
SO STIR UP THE FIRE TILL I BOIL THIS SECOND ONE INDEED SAYS THE BLACK THIEF I WOULD FAIN THINK HE WOULD NOT DIE THIS TIME EITHER HOW SO SAYS THE KNIGHT
THEN HE SWEPT THEM ALL BACK INTO THEIR BAGS AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR FELL FAST ASLEEP SNORING SO LOUD THAT NO OTHER SOUND WAS AUDIBLE
YES I SEE A SMALL CASTLE FAR FAR AWAY SAID THE PRINCESS
THE QUEEN GREATLY INCENSED AT SUCH A DARING INSULT FROM ONE OF HER MEANEST SUBJECTS DEMANDED IMMEDIATELY THE REASON OR SHE WOULD HAVE HER PUT TO DEATH
BE QUICK AND FLING OVER ME THE OX-HIDES THAT HAVE THE SPIKES IN THEM THROW THE TWELVE TONS OF TAR OVER THE FIELD AND CLIMB UP INTO THAT GREAT SPRUCE FIR TREE
IF IT HOLDS WATER I WILL MARRY AGAIN BUT IF IT DOESN'T I WON'T THE GIRL DID AS SHE WAS BID BUT THE WATER DREW THE HOLE TOGETHER AND THE BOOT FILLED UP TO THE VERY TOP
FOR THE BRAVE OLD DAME SHUTS HER SACK SO
BUT THAT SAME EVENING THE SCULLION NOTICED A DUCK SWIMMING UP THE GUTTER SAYING AS IT PASSED
I WILL COMPEL YOU TO RECEIVE ME
NOW GO BACK TO THE PANTRY AND BRING THE BEST OF EVERYTHING YOU FIND THERE SO FRISK WENT BACK AND FILLED HIS BASKET WITH WHITE BREAD AND RED WINE AND EVERY KIND OF SWEETMEAT UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST TOO HEAVY FOR HIM TO CARRY
OH SHE ANSWERED I HAVE BEEN SENT TO GET A BASKETFUL OF STRAWBERRIES AND I DAREN'T SHOW MY FACE AGAIN AT HOME TILL I BRING THEM WITH ME WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED HER BREAD THEY GAVE HER A BROOM AND TOLD HER TO SWEEP AWAY THE SNOW FROM THE BACK DOOR
SHE MIGHT BE A QUEEN TO-MORROW IF SHE CHOSE
BELLS WERE PEALING CHIMES RINGING AND THE PEOPLE FILLING THE STREETS AND STANDING AT THEIR DOORS TO WATCH THE PROCESSION GO BY AND THEY COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THEIR EYES AS THEY SAW WHAT A STRANGE BRIDE THEIR PRINCE HAD CHOSEN
SHE IS AS WICKED AS SHE IS UGLY
ALL THE NAMES IN THE CALENDAR ARE TAKEN WHEN THE YOUNG MAN HEARD THIS ANSWER HE REPLIED
THE KING WHO WAS VERY MUCH ANNOYED TO SEE HOW GREATLY SHE DISLIKED IT TOOK A MIRROR AND HOLDING IT UP BEFORE THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS SAID
WHEN HE AWOKE HE WAS HORRIFIED AND GAVE ORDERS TO PLUCK ANOTHER GOOSE TO STUFF IT WITH CHESTNUTS AND PUT IT ON THE SPIT
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE MOTHER WANTED HER OWN DAUGHTER TO GO TO THE STREAM TO FETCH SOME WATER
BUT THE MOMENT THE PRINCE CLOSED HIS EYES UP JUMPED THE BEAST AND TOOK TO FLIGHT
BY-AND-BY THE GIANT CAME HOME AND AS SOON AS HE HAD CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE ROARED OUT
AND THEN SHE GOT OUT THE FLASK WHICH CONTAINED NOTHING BUT BRANDY AND HER HANDS TREMBLED SO THAT SHE SHOOK THE BOTTLE ABOUT AND WHEN SHE DRANK IT MADE A GREAT GULP IN HER THROAT
AND THIS IS WHY THE COUNTRY GIRLS GO ABOUT SINGING
IT IS SHE
HE SPENT TWO NIGHTS IN THE TENT AND HE FOUND FAVOUR IN THE EYES OF MARYA MOREVNA AND SHE MARRIED HIM
WHEN SHE WAS READY NOBODY COULD HAVE BEEN PRETTIER BUT SHE STILL COULD NOT HELP LOOKING SAD
THEN YOU HAVE MET WITH THE SAME FATE AS I HAVE SAID HE
ONE DAY THE MOTHER SAID TO THE CHILD
II ONE MORNING ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST JUST AT MID-DAY WHEN THE SUN WAS HOTTEST MICHAEL ATE HIS DINNER OF A PIECE OF DRY BREAD AND WENT TO SLEEP UNDER AN OAK
THEN THE QUEEN IN DISMAY CRIED THAT THERE MUST BE SOME MALIGNANT INFLUENCE AT WORK AND THAT SHE WOULD CHOOSE NO MORE THAT DAY
SO HE WENT IN AND INSIDE THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS BUSY ABOUT SOME WORK
THIS FATAL SKEIN WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME IF YOU WILL NOT FORGIVE ME AND HELP ME ONCE MORE AND IMMEDIATELY IN CAME PERCINET AS EASILY AS IF HE HAD ALL THE KEYS IN HIS OWN POSSESSION
THE NEXT TIME THAT HE RODE AT IT HE GOT A LITTLE FARTHER UP BUT THEN ONE OF DAPPLEGRIM'S FORE LEGS SLIPPED AND DOWN THEY WENT WITH THE SOUND OF A LANDSLIP
IF KOSHCHEI CATCHES US YOU WILL BE CUT IN PIECES AGAIN NO HE WON'T CATCH US
BEFORE JACK AND HIS MOTHER HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR ALARM AND AGITATION A BEAUTIFUL LADY STOOD BEFORE THEM
WHEN THEY HAD GREETED HIM THEY SAID
HOW DARE YOU SHE SAID WITH A WRATHFUL GLANCE CLIMB INTO MY GARDEN AND STEAL MY RAMPION LIKE A COMMON THIEF
WELL PRINCE IVAN
AT LAST HE GOT A CHANCE AND FIRED AND THE DEAD BODY FELL WITH A LOUD THUD TO THE GROUND AND DOWN WENT THE MASTER THIEF TOO AS FAST AS HE COULD
RAPUNZEL WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHILD UNDER THE SUN
OH I SHAKE ME SHAKE ME MY APPLES ARE ALL QUITE RIPE SHE DID AS SHE WAS ASKED AND SHOOK THE TREE TILL THE APPLES FELL LIKE RAIN AND NONE WERE LEFT HANGING
AND ALL THE PEOPLE GAZED AT HER AND WONDERED WHO THE LOVELY MAIDEN WAS AND FROM WHAT CASTLE SHE CAME
THE YOUTH DENIED THAT HE HAD SAID THIS BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE FOR THE KING WAS DEAF TO ALL HIS WORDS
HE IS LORD OVER ALL THE BIRDS IN THE AIR--ASK HIM
I LEAVE YOU TO ENJOY ITS COMPANY AND FOR MY OWN PART I THANK MY STARS THAT I CAN GET PLENTY OF MICE WITHOUT TROUBLING YOU TO GIVE THEM TO ME AND SHE HOBBLED OFF GRUMBLING AND GROWLING
THEN HE WENT ON TO THE WELL DREW UP THE CORD WHICH WAS HALF ROTTEN AND STRETCHED IT OUT IN THE SUN
INSTANTLY A MAN CAME FORTH AND ASKED WHAT SHE WANTED
THE EARTH IS ALL FROZEN AND THE SNOW HAS COVERED UP EVERYTHING
MOON SHE SCREAMED
WHAT IS THERE TO SEE HERE COMPARED WITH WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AT THE PALACE
THIS BARGAIN MUST BE MADE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY AND HERE IS A PACK OF CARDS SAYS SHE THAT I AM THINKING YOU WILL NOT LOSE BY THE QUEEN IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CARDS AND AFTER RETURNING THE HEN-WIFE THANKS FOR HER KIND INSTRUCTION WENT BACK TO THE PALACE WHERE SHE WAS QUITE UNEASY UNTIL SHE GOT SPEAKING TO THE KING IN REGARD OF HIS CHILDREN
I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE I ASSURE YOU MADAM SAID THE PRINCESS THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND AM QUITE WILLING THAT YOU SHALL BE DECLARED QUEEN OF BEAUTY AH
YOU ARE A VERY GOOD BOY BUT I WISH YOU WOULD NOT RISK YOUR PRECIOUS LIFE IN THE GIANT'S CASTLE
SO AT DUSK OVER HE GOT BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE OTHER SIDE HE DREW BACK IN TERROR FOR THERE STANDING BEFORE HIM WAS THE OLD WITCH
LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT I WAS WALKING IN A WOOD WHERE THE TREES WERE COVERED WITH GOLDEN APPLES
AH PRINCESS SAID THE QUEEN DON'T KEEP THIS POOR PERCINET IN SUSPENSE ANY LONGER
I HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER YOU BUT I GIVE THIS WILLINGLY IN RETURN FOR THE AMUSEMENT I HAVE HAD FROM YOU SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN SHE SAW UPON THE TABLE A DELICIOUS LITTLE ROAST PARTRIDGE AND TWO DISHES OF PRESERVED FRUIT
SORIA MORIA CASTLE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A COUPLE OF FOLKS WHO HAD A SON CALLED HALVOR
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO WATCH FOR THE WOLF AND SPLIT HIS SKULL WITH A BLOW FROM MY AXE NO REPLIED RENELDE THERE MUST BE NO BLOOD ON MY BRIDAL BOUQUET
WHEN HE WAS LOST TO SIGHT THE QUEEN COULD DO NOTHING BUT WEEP AND WRING HER HANDS AND CRY
NEXT DAY THE SECOND SON SAID THAT HE WOULD NOW GO OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
DON'T GO KEEPING THEM BY YOU THEY DIED AND THE PRINCE BURIED THEM AND THEN TO SOLACE HIS GRIEF HE WENT WITH HIS SISTERS INTO THE GARDEN GREEN TO STROLL
BOTH YOUR BROTHERS HAVE INJURED THEMSELVES
AT THAT MOMENT A SLIGHT SOUND BEHIND HER MADE HER START ROUND AND THERE STOOD PERCINET HIMSELF
THEY SOON MET THE KING WHO WAS DRIVING ABOUT IN A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GOLDEN CARRIAGE WHICH GLITTERED WITH DIAMONDS AND WAS DRAWN AT FULL SPEED BY TWELVE PEACOCKS
HOWEVER HE CAUSED THE TOWER TO BE BUILT AND HIS SONS PLACED IN IT UNDER PROPER GUARDIANS ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE
THE FIRST WAS THE PRINCESS MARYA THE SECOND THE PRINCESS OLGA THE THIRD THE PRINCESS ANNA
BUT THE PRINCESS SCARCELY GAVE A GLANCE TO ANY OF THESE TREASURES FOR SHE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT FANFARONADE
HER SPINNING-WHEEL AND THE MILK OF A COW WHICH SHE HAD PURCHASED WITH THE LITTLE MONEY SHE HAD WITH HER SUFFICED FOR THE SCANTY SUBSISTENCE OF HERSELF AND HER LITTLE SON
SHE MIGHT HAVE HUMBLED HIS PRIDE HAD SHE GONE TO HER SPINNING-WHEEL AGAIN BUT SHE DID NOTHING OF THE SORT
THE ROE WAS PETTED AND CARESSED AND RAN ABOUT AT WILL IN THE PALACE GARDENS
BUT THIS WILL COST US A DEAL OF MONEY LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR SAID THE TOWN COUNCIL WITH A MALICIOUS AIR
THE PRINCESS WENT POKING ABOUT AND SEARCHING EVERYWHERE HIGH AND LOW AND WANTED TO GO INTO DAPPLEGRIM'S STALL TOO BUT HE BEGAN TO BITE AND KICK ABOUT SO THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THERE AND COULD NOT FIND THE YOUTH
JUST KILL THE TWELVE LITTLE FOALS AGAIN SO THAT I CAN SUCK THE MARES THIS YEAR ALSO AND THEN COME AND LOOK AT ME IN THE SUMMER SO THE YOUTH DID IT--HE KILLED ALL THE LITTLE FOALS AND THEN WENT HOME AGAIN
I MUST LEAVE YOU AT ONCE AND WE SHALL NOT MEET AGAIN UNTIL YOU HAVE WORN OUT THREE PAIRS OF IRON SHOES AND BLUNTED A STEEL STAFF IN YOUR SEARCH FOR ME SO SAYING HE DISAPPEARED
GIVE ME MORE THE PRINCE GAVE HIM A SECOND BUCKETFUL
THEN THE STRANGER HAD BEGUN TO WALK QUICKLY AND THEY HAD FOLLOWED RUNNING SINGING AND DANCING TO THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC AS FAR AS THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WHICH ONE SEES ON ENTERING HAMEL
IN THE MORNING THE KITCHEN-MAID RELATED WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD AND THE KING SAID THAT NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT HE HIMSELF WOULD WATCH IN THE KITCHEN AND SEE IF THIS WERE TRUE AND WHEN IT HAD BEGUN TO GROW DARK HE WENT OUT INTO THE KITCHEN TO THE GIRL
AH ME SAID TITTY SO YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR POOR ZIZI
YOU WILL ASK HER HOW SHE IS AND COME BACK AT ONCE WITHOUT STOPPING TO CHATTER ON THE WAY WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW
CONSOLE YOURSELF MY MAN SAID THE GOVERNOR LAUGHING
THE FOLLOWING DAY HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR AND WANTED TO HAVE HIS DAUGHTER ACCORDING TO PROMISE
NOW I HEAR SUCH A DREADFUL CRACKLING AND CRASHING IN THE FOREST ON EVERY SIDE THAT I THINK I SHALL BE REALLY AFRAID SAID THE YOUTH
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW THAT THE KING WAS SO SORRY FOR HER PRETENDED DEATH THAT HE COULD NEITHER EAT NOR DRINK SHE CRIED
DEAR CHILD THEY BELONG TO YOUR TWELVE BROTHERS BUT WHERE ARE MY TWELVE BROTHERS SAID THE GIRL
THEY SPENT SOME TIME TOGETHER AND THEN THE PRINCESS TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD TO GO A WARRING
I HAVE DONE ALL THIS FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE KIND AND MERCIFUL TO ME THEN HE GAVE DULLHEAD A SHIP WHICH COULD SAIL ON LAND OR WATER AND WHEN THE KING SAW IT HE FELT HE COULD NO LONGER REFUSE HIM HIS DAUGHTER
SO ALL THE COUNSELLORS WERE SUMMONED TO THE PALACE AND WHEN THEY HAD SHUT EVERY DOOR AND WINDOW AND STUFFED UP EVERY KEYHOLE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE OVERHEARD THEY TALKED THE AFFAIR OVER AND DECIDED THAT EVERY FAIRY FOR A THOUSAND LEAGUES ROUND SHOULD BE INVITED TO THE CHRISTENING OF THE PRINCESS AND THAT THE TIME OF THE CEREMONY SHOULD BE KEPT A PROFOUND SECRET IN CASE THE FAIRY CARABOSSE SHOULD TAKE IT INTO HER HEAD TO ATTEND IT
THEN GUNNAR TRIED SIGURD'S HORSE GRANI BUT HE WOULD NOT MOVE WITH GUNNAR ON HIS BACK
NOW AS THE KING KNEW THAT ABOVE ALL OTHER THINGS THE QUEEN LOVED TO BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL HE ORDERED THAT HER PORTRAIT SHOULD BE PAINTED AND THAT A TOURNAMENT SHOULD BE HELD AT WHICH ALL THE BRAVEST KNIGHTS OF HIS COURT SHOULD MAINTAIN AGAINST ALL COMERS THAT GRUMBLY WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS IN THE WORLD
BE OFF THIS MOMENT
SO THEY HAD TO WAIT A DAY AND THE BULL TOLD THE KING'S DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE HORN OF OINTMENT WHICH HUNG AT THE TROLL'S BELT AND RUB HIM WITH IT
POOR DESIRE WHO HAD BRAVED SO MANY DANGERS TO WIN THE LADY OF HIS DREAMS WOULD HAVE GIVEN AT THIS MOMENT ALL THE PRINCESSES IN THE WORLD WERE THEY PINK OR GOLDEN FOR A SINGLE DROP OF WATER
IN THE MEANTIME MIND YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR KINGDOM ROSETTE THANKED THEM FOR ALL THE TROUBLE THEY WERE TAKING ON HER ACCOUNT AND PROMISED TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE KINGDOM AND ONLY TO AMUSE HERSELF BY LOOKING AT THE PEACOCK AND MAKING FRISK DANCE WHILE THEY WERE AWAY
HE WAS VERY SORRY AND MOTHER AND SON WENT TO BED VERY SADLY THAT NIGHT
BROKE OFF A GOOSE'S WINGS AND SET THEM ON HIS BACK
BUT WHEN YOU GET HOME DON'T LET THE BABA YAGA SET EYES ON YOU BUT GO INTO THE STABLE AND HIDE BEHIND THE MANGERS
SET YOUR CLUMSY FINGERS TO WORK UPON IT FOR I MUST HAVE IT DISENTANGLED BY SUNSET AND IF YOU BREAK A SINGLE THREAD IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU SO SAYING SHE LEFT HER LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH THREE KEYS
AFTER A YEAR THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A LITTLE SON
I WILL PURSUE AFTER A TIME HE CAME UP WITH PRINCE IVAN LIGHTED ON THE GROUND AND WAS GOING TO CHOP HIM UP WITH HIS SHARP SWORD
EVERYBODY WAS AMUSED AT FRISK'S ANTICS BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN HE RAN AWAY INTO A LITTLE WOOD AND THE PRINCESS WAS FOLLOWING HIM WHEN TO HER GREAT DELIGHT SHE SAW A PEACOCK WHO WAS SPREADING HIS TAIL IN THE SUNSHINE
HE IS CLOSE BEHIND US NOW SAID THE MAN
WHILE HE WAS GOING QUICKLY THROUGH THE AIR HE FELL IN WITH THE NORTH WIND
THEN THEY LOCKED THE DOOR AND RAN AWAY
YOU KNOW ME THEN SAID SHE
WHEN THE BROTHER ARRIVED AT HOME TO FETCH HIS SISTER HER STEPMOTHER AND STEP-SISTER WOULD GO TOO
EVERY EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE GUILBERT CAME TO VISIT HIS FUTURE BRIDE
IS IT OF YOUR OWN ACCORD OR ON COMPULSION I HAVE COME TO EARN FROM YOU AN HEROIC STEED SO BE IT PRINCE
SORCERER OR NO IF THIS BAGPIPER SPEAKS THE TRUTH IT WAS HE WHO SENT US THIS HORRIBLE VERMIN THAT HE WANTS TO RID US OF TO-DAY FOR MONEY
AT LAST THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT BUT ONE WRETCHED OLD HAG WHO WAS LYING BEHIND THE STOVE
UP CAME RUNNING THE LIONESS
SO SHE BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HER MORE TIME TO THINK OF IT AND HE HAD TO GO AWAY DISAPPOINTED ONCE MORE
CAN YOU TELL ME WHICH IS THE HORSE I HAVE CAUGHT AND WHICH IS THE ONE I HAD BEFORE SAID THE YOUTH
AND SO IT WAS THAT THE CHILD THROVE TILL NOT A FINER BOY WAS TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE
AND WHEN THE PRINCESS PRESENTED THE LETTER AND THE BOX SHE THREW THEM BOTH UPON THE FIRE WITHOUT OPENING THEM AND LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO THROW THE PRINCESS AFTER THEM
THE KING EXCLAIMED GOOD HEAVENS
EACH OF THEM WAS TO TAKE AN ARM AND SHAKE HIM AND JERK HIM BY THE ARM WHENEVER HE SEEMED TO BE GOING TO FALL ASLEEP
THE NEXT DAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND THE NEXT SO THAT FOR THREE DAYS THE KING GOT NOTHING AT ALL TO EAT BECAUSE JUST WHEN THE DINNER OR THE SUPPER WAS READY TO BE SERVED IT MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED
THE NETTLE SPINNER I ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED AT QUESNOY IN FLANDERS A GREAT LORD WHOSE NAME WAS BURCHARD BUT WHOM THE COUNTRY PEOPLE CALLED BURCHARD THE WOLF
BUT ALL THE PRINCESS GUARDS WERE SO FOND OF HIM THAT THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY DARED IN SPITE OF THE KING TO MAKE THE TIME PASS PLEASANTLY
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I WILL HAVE ANY WATER THAT YOU BRING SAID THE PRINCE AND EMPTIED IT OVER HER
GRACIOSA MUCH AGAINST HER WILL WAS FORCED INTO IT AND AWAY THEY DROVE AND NEVER STOPPED UNTIL THEY REACHED A GREAT FOREST A HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM THE PALACE
KING GRUMPY WAS QUITE DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT HIS SON WAS ILL FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD ALL THE SOONER BE BROUGHT TO DO AS HE WISHED AND MARRY THE PRINCESS
ON SEEING THEM THE PARSON CALLED OUT AND BEGGED THEM TO COME AND RESCUE HIM AND THE CLERK
THAT'S EASILY SAID
WHEN HE IS AT HOME I MUST HIDE YOU FOR HE HAS EATEN UP ALL MY PAGES HITHERTO AND YOU WOULD BE A DAINTY MORSEL MY LITTLE LAD WHILE SHE SPOKE SHE DRAGGED JACK RIGHT INTO THE CASTLE
NO THAT HE CERTAINLY COULD NOT
OUT CAME THE PRINCE AND WHEN HE SAW THAT IT WAS KARI HE SNATCHED THE TOWEL FROM HER AND FLUNG IT RIGHT IN HER EYES
THEN SOMEONE CAME BY AND THREW A STONE AT THE OTTER AND KILLED IT AND FLAYED OFF THE SKIN AND TOOK IT TO THE HOUSE OF OTTER'S FATHER
SHE SHALL DIE A MOST MISERABLE DEATH THE GIRL SEARCHED FOR STRAWBERRIES BUT SHE FOUND NONE AND RETURNED HOME IN A VERY BAD TEMPER
THE BRAVE WASP'S-NEST RUSHES OUT WITH ALL HIS WASPS
AUDACIOUS VILLAINS SAYS THE KNIGHT OF THE GLEN HOW DARE YOU ATTEMPT SO BOLD AN ACTION AS TO STEAL MY STEED
I WILL GIVE YOU LEAVE ON ONE CONDITION
SO THEN DULLHEAD SAID
BUT SHE ANSWERED
THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WE SHALL SEE THAT HE IS JUST THE SAME RAGAMUFFIN THAT HE WAS BEFORE SAID THE GIRLS TOSSING THEIR HEADS
IF YOU REMAIN AS YOU ARE NOW YOU SHALL BE WISE AND AMIABLE AND MODEST ALAS I MADAM CRIED THE PRINCESS IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AT ONCE WISE AND BEAUTIFUL NO CHILD ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN ONLY TO YOU IT IS DECREED THAT YOU MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO
BUT WHEN THEY WERE READY FOR THE WEDDING THE YOUNGEST BRIDE SAID TO THE KING
EVEN IF HE HAD SIX MORE I WOULD NOT HE WILL SWALLOW YOU UP ALIVE SAID THE PRINCESS
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF BEING A QUEEN IF ONE IS TO BE SLIGHTED LIKE THIS UPON THIS THE KING COMMANDED GRACIOSA TO DISMOUNT AND TO BEG THE DUCHESS TO HONOUR HER BY MOUNTING HER HORSE
AND IT WAS DONE AS HE COMMANDED
WHO IS THAT AND WHAT AILS YOU SAID SHE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MY GOOD MAN ASKED HE
DO YOU THINK THE PRINCE WILL EVER LOOK AT SUCH A FRIGHT AS YOU SHE WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP HOWEVER BUT WENT ON BEGGING UNTIL AT LAST SHE GOT LEAVE
JACK THAT POOR LADY IS YOUR MOTHER
I AM SO OVERWORKED AND I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD NOT HAVE A PAGE AS WELL AS OTHER LADIES
BUT IT BROUGHT GOOD LUCK TO NOBODY
GOOD OLD MAN DO SAVE ME OR I SHALL DIE OF COLD AND HUNGER WHEN HE HEARD HER CRY OUT SO PITEOUSLY HE WAS VERY SORRY FOR HER AND RAN BACK INTO HIS HOUSE TO FETCH A LONG BOAT-HOOK
BUT WHEN YOU CARED FOR THE POOR LITTLE MOUSE YOU COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS ANYTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT AND TO TRY YOU FURTHER I TOOK THE FORM OF THE OLD WOMAN WHOM YOU TALKED TO FROM THE WINDOW AND THEN I WAS CONVINCED THAT YOU REALLY LOVED ME THEN TURNING TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS SHE KISSED HER ROSY LIPS THREE TIMES SAYING
SO DOWN IT WENT TO THE BOTTOM AND THE THIRD HEAD CAME UP
WELL ON THE THIRD DAY THE YOUNGEST SON UNDERTOOK THE TASK
AT FULL SPEED DID SHE FLY IN HER IRON MORTAR URGING IT ON WITH THE PESTLE SWEEPING AWAY HER TRACES WITH THE BROOM
HE IS STAYING JUST NOW WITH MY SECOND SISTER WHO LIVES NOT FAR FROM HERE IN A SILVER PALACE
FE FA FI-FO-FUM I SMELL THE BREATH OF AN ENGLISHMAN
FE FA FI-FO-FUM I SMELL THE BREATH OF AN ENGLISHMAN
FE FA FI-FO-FUM I SMELL THE BREATH OF AN ENGLISHMAN
NOBODY
HE THOUGHT THIS TIME IT WAS ALL UP WITH HIM
ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY A TROLL TO HIS CASTLE WHICH WAS SIX MILES OFF AND THE OTHER HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF TO A CASTLE WHICH WAS NINE MILES FARTHER OFF STILL
IF THEY ARE BOTH THERE WHY SHOULD NOT I BE THERE TOO SO SHE SPRANG TO THEM
HER HAIR BLACK AS EBONY WAS SPREAD ACROSS THE PILLOWS MAKING HER FACE LOOK IVORY WHITE AND THE PRINCE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS UNQUIET
WHEN HE ARRIVED THIS OLD WOMAN ALSO WAS STANDING DRAWING WATER OUT OF THE WELL WITH HER NOSE
WHEN THE MAN GOT HOME THE OLD WOMAN INQUIRED WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE SON
I SHOULD ONLY JUST SEE WHAT WAS THERE AND WITHOUT FARTHER HESITATION SHE LIFTED THE COVER
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN-MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
THEY RETURNED HOME BUT THEY HADN'T HAD TIME TO SIT DOWN WHEN THE THUNDER CRASHED THE CEILING SPLIT OPEN AND IN FLEW A RAVEN
PRESENTLY THE MIDNIGHT HOUR SOUNDED
SO HE HAD FOUND HER ONCE
AT LAST HE REACHED A COUNTRY WHERE HE WAS TOLD THAT THE PEOPLE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD DEATH
THE QUEEN HOWEVER PRETENDED TO BE ILL AND GAVE THE DOCTOR MUCH MONEY TO SAY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE WELL AGAIN UNLESS SHE HAD SOME OF THE FLESH OF THE BLUE BULL TO EAT
YOU WICKED CHILD CRIED THE WITCH
AND THE MAN HAD A DAUGHTER AND SO HAD THE WOMAN
IN THE MEANTIME THE WEDDING-DAY DREW NEAR
SHE BEGAN TO GET QUITE ILL AND IN A FEW DAYS SHE WAS SO CHANGED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO RECOGNISE HER
THE FALCON FLEW AWAY FOR THE WATER OF LIFE AND THE RAVEN FOR THE WATER OF DEATH
NOW I WILL LET YOU SEE ONE OF MY BLOWS SO SAYING HE GRASPED HIS SWORD AND CUT AT THE TROLL IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALL HIS FIFTEEN HEADS DANCED AWAY OVER THE SANDS
DULLHEAD BETHOUGHT HIM OF THE LITTLE GREY MAN WHO COULD HE FELT SURE HELP HIM
YOU WILL COME TO A VAST PARK SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS
SO HE SET HIMSELF TO WORK TO CATCH THREE HARES ALIVE PUT THEM IN A BAG CLAD HIMSELF IN SOME OLD RAGS SO THAT HE LOOKED SO POOR AND WRETCHED THAT IT WAS QUITE PITIABLE TO SEE HIM AND IN THIS GUISE ON SUNDAY FORENOON HE SNEAKED INTO THE PASSAGE WITH HIS BAG LIKE ANY BEGGAR BOY
THE MARES ARE ALL COLLECTED PRINCE IVAN AROSE AND WENT HOME
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ENTER GOOD SAYS DRAKESTAIL TO HIMSELF I SHALL NOW SEE HOW THEY EAT AT COURT THIS WAY THIS WAY SAYS THE PORTER
DO YOU STEAL IT AND AT THE DEAD OF NIGHT RIDE AWAY FROM THE HOUSE PRINCE IVAN AROSE SLIPPED INTO THE STABLE AND LAY DOWN BEHIND THE MANGERS WHILE THE BABA YAGA WAS STORMING AWAY AT HER MARES AND SHRIEKING
I'LL PAY THEM OUT YET SAID SHE NODDING HER HEAD WITH AN AIR OF GREAT DETERMINATION
PERHAPS HE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO TO PREVENT THE MISFORTUNES WHICH THE FAIRIES FORETOLD SHE SET OUT VERY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING MOUNTED UPON A PRETTY LITTLE WHITE MULE WHICH WAS SHOD WITH SOLID GOLD AND TWO OF HER LADIES RODE BEHIND HER ON BEAUTIFUL HORSES
MAY YOUR LIFE BE AS PROSPEROUS AND BRIGHT AS SUNRISE ON A CLEAR DAY I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU WELL FRIEND ANSWERED THE KING BUT WHAT WIND HAS BROUGHT YOU HITHER I COME A-WOOING REPLIED THE PIG
HIGH OVER HINDFELL RED FIRE IS FLAMING THERE DOTH THE MAIDEN DWELL SHE THAT SHOULD LOVE THEE WELL MEET FOR THY TAMING
FOR I KNOW ALL THE WAYS OF THE PLACE AND IF THERE BE ANY CHANCE FOR IT IT IS WHEN THEY ARE ALL AT REST
QUI VIVRA VERRA
SHE FELT QUITE EXCITED AS IT WAS SO LONG SINCE SHE HAD SEEN A HUMAN BEING AND SHE CALLED OUT TO THE OLD WOMAN TO COME AND TALK TO HER
BUT THE KING WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO DO ANYTHING SO WRONG AND HE COMFORTED HER IN ALL POSSIBLE WAYS
NO NO MY LITTLE SHEPHERDESS SAID HE THAT IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU
AND HER THOUGHTS WERE SO DOLEFUL THAT VERY SOON SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SHE CRIED AND CRIED AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE PALACE UNTIL SHE SUDDENLY SAW A HANDSOME PAGE STANDING BEFORE HER
SO SHORTLY BEFORE ANOTHER BABY WAS BORN HE WENT AWAY INTO THE WOOD FOR SOME FIREWOOD SAYING THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE NEW CHILD
I WILL SET OUT IN SEARCH OF MY SISTERS HE GOT READY FOR THE JOURNEY HE RODE AND RODE AND ONE DAY HE SAW A WHOLE ARMY LYING DEAD ON THE PLAIN
NOW THE WITCH THE MOTHER OF GUDRUN WANTED HER SON GUNNAR TO MARRY BRYNHILD AND SHE BADE HIM RIDE OUT WITH SIGURD AND GO AND WOO HER
RAPUNZEL RAPUNZEL LET DOWN YOUR GOLDEN HAIR SHE LET THEM DOWN AND THE PRINCE CLIMBED UP AS USUAL BUT INSTEAD OF HIS BELOVED RAPUNZEL HE FOUND THE OLD WITCH WHO FIXED HER EVIL GLITTERING EYES ON HIM AND CRIED MOCKINGLY
THOU MY CHERUB SAYS SHE WHITHER SO LONESOME WITH ARCHING TAIL ON THIS MUDDY ROAD I AM GOING TO THE KING YOU KNOW FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH
BEHIND HER CAME THE QUEEN WEARING A BLUE VELVET ROBE EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD AND A DIAMOND CROWN THAT WAS BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN ITSELF
THE KING IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE LAD INTO HIS PRESENCE AND SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT HE HAD SAID THAT IT WAS IN HIS POWER TO RESCUE THE PRINCESS SO HE WAS NOW TO DO IT
AND THE GOOD PEOPLE OF HAMEL REPEATED WITH THEIR COUNSELLORS LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR TOWARDS NINE AT NIGHT THE BAGPIPER RE-APPEARED ON THE MARKET PLACE
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO PUT BACK THE TERRIBLE BOX AND FLY FROM THE TURRET
SO HE HASTENED TO APPEASE THE DUCHESS AND TOLD HER SHE MIGHT PUNISH GRACIOSA IN ANY WAY SHE PLEASED
HE WILL CATCH US SUPPOSE HE DOES CATCH US
I BOUND UP THREE OF THE WOUNDS WHICH THOU DIDST GIVE HIM WELL AFTER THIS THEY DRANK AND ENJOYED THEMSELVES AND HELD SWEET CONVERSE TOGETHER AND THEN THE PRINCE TOOK LEAVE OF HER AND WENT ON TO THE SECOND SISTER THE ONE WHO LIVED IN THE SILVER PALACE AND WITH HER ALSO HE STAYED AWHILE
I DO NOT MYSELF BELIEVE THAT HE ALWAYS WAS A PIG
SO THE TIME PASSED TILL LO AND BEHOLD
SO THE KING HAD DECREED THAT WHOEVER SHOULD SUCCEED IN MAKING HER LAUGH SHOULD MARRY HER
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT NOW I SHALL NEVER COME AGAIN SHE SAID AND THEN SHE TURNED TO GO
KEEP OFF
IT WAS SO GOLDEN THAT THE GOLD DRIPPED OFF IT AND THE TREES AND THE BRANCHES AND THE FLOWERS AND THE LEAVES WERE ALL OF PURE GOLD
THE HEAD JUMPED OFF SAYING THE WHILE WELL I'M DONE FOR NOW AND ROLLED FAR AWAY INTO THE SEA
TELL ME HOW YOU CAME TO GO THERE AGAIN AND JACK TOLD HER ALL ABOUT IT
GIVE ME SOME OF MY BROTHERS OLD CLOTHES AND FOOD FOR SOME DAYS AND THEN I WILL GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND FIND MY TWIN BROTHER FOR YOU HAVE CHILDREN ENOUGH HEAVEN HELP THEE LITTLE CREATURE
THERE THEY SAT DOWN AND WHEN THEY HAD SAT FOR A SHORT TIME THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS SAID I MAY AS WELL COMB YOUR HAIR A LITTLE HALVOR SO HALVOR LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON HER LAP AND SHE COMBED IT AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE FELL ASLEEP
HERE IS ONE WHO WOULD GO THITHER YES I KNOW IT WELL SAID THE WEST WIND
THE PRINCE WAS SO GRIEVED AT THIS WANT OF CONFIDENCE THAT HE LEFT HER WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
GO SAID HE TO JACK-THE-CHATTERER TELL THE ADMIRAL FROM ME TO LAND AT ONCE
FORMERLY SHE HAD BEEN ROSY AND MERRY NOW SHE WAS PALE AND NOTHING GAVE HER ANY PLEASURE
WHEN THE BROTHERS HEARD THIS THEY WERE VERY ANGRY AND SAID
HOLD ME AS I AM HOLDING YOU
BE AS ACCOMPLISHED AS YOU ARE HANDSOME AND TAKE THE NAME OF PRINCE PEERLESS SINCE THAT IS THE ONLY TITLE WHICH WILL SUIT YOU NOW SILENT FROM JOY THE PRINCE KISSED HER HAND TO EXPRESS HIS THANKS AND WHEN HE ROSE AND SAW HIS NEW REFLECTION IN THE MIRRORS WHICH SURROUNDED HIM HE UNDERSTOOD THAT CURLICUE WAS INDEED GONE FOR EVER
WHEN SHE REACHED THE BAKER'S OVEN THE BREAD CALLED OUT AS BEFORE
HE WOULD THINK HANGING TOO GOOD FOR ME OH IN THAT CASE SHE ANSWERED WE HAD BETTER GO TO SQUIRREL ISLAND
THE PRIME MINISTER FOLLOWED HASTILY AND TRACKED HIM ALL THROUGH THE TOWN TO THE COTTAGE OF THE GOOD OLD MAN
THEY HAD HAD A BOY WHO WAS CALLED HALVOR BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE HAD GONE AND THEY COULD NOT EVEN SAY WHETHER HE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE
THE OLD WOMAN WENT OUT AND CRIED
WAIT THERE TILL I RETURN SAID THE FIDDLER AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY
WHAT CRIED THE SLY TITTY THEY ARE COMING WITH GREAT POMP TO FETCH YOU AND YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO SHOW YOURSELF TO SO MANY FINE LORDS AND LADIES WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN LIKE THAT
KILL THE TWELVE LITTLE FOALS AND THEN I CAN SUCK ALL THE MARES THIS YEAR ALSO AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW BIG AND HANDSOME I SHALL BE BY SUMMER SO THE YOUTH DID IT AGAIN AND WHEN HE WENT UP ON THE HILL NEXT YEAR TO LOOK AFTER HIS COLT AND THE MARES EACH OF THE MARES HAD HER FOAL AGAIN
THE SHOP WAS FULL OF PEOPLE AND HIS CHIN HAD JUST BEEN COVERED WITH A LATHER OF SOAP WHEN SUDDENLY STARTING UP FROM THE CHAIR HE CALLED OUT IN A LOUD VOICE
SO HER MISTRESS SOON GREW WEARY OF HER AND DISMISSED HER MUCH TO THE LAZY CREATURE'S DELIGHT
THE DOOR WAS OPENED IN A MINUTE OR TWO BY A FRIGHTFUL GIANTESS WITH ONE GREAT EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FOREHEAD
AS SOON AS THE QUEEN GOT HOME SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO HER MIRROR AND ASKED
MY CHILDREN SHE SAID ALL THE YEARS THAT I HAVE LIVED IN THE WORLD I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A SHIFT SPUN FROM NETTLES
BUT THE EAGLE UTTERING A DOLOROUS CRY FLUTTERED HIS BROAD WINGS AND DISAPPEARED
DO YOU CALL THAT PROPER BEHAVIOUR AND WITH THAT HE CAUGHT THE YOUNGEST GIRL BY THE HAND TO TRY AND DRAW HER AWAY
BREAK OFF ONE OF MY BRANCHES AND STRIKE THE HEARTH WITH IT CROSSWISE AND ALL WILL BE PUT RIGHT THE GIRL DID SO
HOW SHALL I KNOW NOW WHETHER MY DELICIA IS BEING TAKEN CARE OF OR NO
BUT THE MAN PULLED OUT HIS ROLL OF TOBACCO AGAIN AND FILLED HIS PIPE WITH SOME OF IT AND GAVE THE OLD WOMAN ENOUGH SNUFF TO COVER THE BACK OF HER HAND
MY HOUSE IS NOT LARGE BUT IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD A STRANGER THE TRAVELLER ENTERED AND HIS HOST PUT BEFORE HIM A SIMPLE MEAL
HIS WIFE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ALWAYS TENDER AND PITIFUL TO THE POOR AND MISERABLE
NO THANK YOU THERE IS NO NEED
SHE FEARED ANOTHER ROBBERY
BUT PRESENTLY WHEN SHE WAS RESTED AND WISHED TO GO ON HER WAY SHE FOUND THAT DO WHAT SHE WOULD SHE COULD NOT GET THEM BACK INTO THEIR BOX
WHEN THE MAN CAME HOME TO THE OLD WOMAN WITH THIS ANSWER SHE SAID I SHALL BE EQUALLY WELL PLEASED WHATEVER YOU DO WITH HIM
BUT AS HE WAS ON THE WAY HE MET A BUTCHER WHO HAD SOME BEAUTIFUL BEANS IN HIS HAND
BUT HE COULD NOT REST AND SAID THAT HE MUST AND WOULD GO SO AT LAST THEY HAD TO GIVE HIM LEAVE
THEN THE PRINCESS WAS DELIVERED AND SHE THANKED MINNIKIN AND BLESSED HIM FOR SAVING HER
THEN THE PRINCESS AT ONCE ROSE UP FROM THE TABLE AND SAID WHO IS MOST WORTHY TO HAVE ONE OF US--HE WHO HAS DELIVERED US FROM THE TROLLS OR HE WHO IS SITTING HERE AS BRIDEGROOM THERE COULD BE BUT ONE OPINION AS TO THAT EVERYONE THOUGHT AND WHEN HALVOR HEARD WHAT THEY SAID HE WAS NOT LONG IN FLINGING OFF HIS BEGGAR'S RAGS AND ARRAYING HIMSELF AS A BRIDEGROOM
MY LADY QUEEN YOU ARE FAIR TIS TRUE BUT SNOWDROP IS FAIRER FAR THAN YOU WHEN THE WICKED WOMAN HEARD THESE WORDS SHE UTTERED A CURSE AND WAS BESIDE HERSELF WITH RAGE AND MORTIFICATION
NOW MARK WHAT I SAY--IF THE FLAME ASCENDS I CONQUER AND IF IT SINKS I FAIL
SO THE MAN DID THIS AND NO SOONER HAD HE FLUNG THEM DOWN THAN THE FEATHERS BECAME A FLOCK OF RAVENS WHICH CHASED THE CROWS HOME AGAIN
AND BENJAMIN AND HIS SISTER COOKED THEIR MEALS FOR THEM
BRING HIM HERE QUICK CRIED HE
WHEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER HEARD IT SHE WAS FULL OF SORROW AND WENT DOWN TO THE BYRE TO THE BULL
THIS IS HE THE RATCATCHER THE TOWN COUNCIL HAD JUST ASSEMBLED TO CONSIDER ONCE MORE THIS PLAGUE OF EGYPT FROM WHICH NO ONE COULD SAVE THE TOWN
THE ENEMY IS APPROACHING US WITH A LARGE ARMY
THE WONDERFUL BIRCH ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO HAD AN ONLY DAUGHTER
MY NICE LITTLE GOLDEN-HOOD SAID HE
IT MAY BE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER TWO KNOWS WHERE HE IS TO BE FOUND
DURING MY ABSENCE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES AND BE GOOD GIRLS
I WANT TO COME IN SO THE YOUTH SPRANG TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKED IT BUT IN HIS HASTE HE FORGOT TO HIDE THE PICTURE
THE FIRST THING BURCHARD DID WAS TO SEND TO RENELDE AND TO STOP HER WHEEL
FOR EACH ONE A BLUE VELVET CLOAK A PETTICOAT OF APRICOT SATIN A PAIR OF HIGH-HEELED SHOES SOME SHARP NEEDLES AND A PAIR OF GOLDEN SCISSORS
NEXT SUNDAY SOME ONE HAD TO TAKE UP A TOWEL TO THE PRINCE
DESIRE GAVE HER THE BRUSH WHICH SHE TOOK IN SILENCE
WHY DO YOU WEEP LITTLE DAUGHTER THE WITCH HAS SCATTERED BARLEYCORNS ON THE HEARTH AND BID ME PICK THEM OUT OF THE ASHES SAID THE GIRL
BUT ALL THESE SHAPES THE KING'S SON WENT ON DESTROYING TILL SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM IN HUMAN FORM AGAIN
IN THE MEANTIME THE BOY GOT UP AND BEGAN TO TALK TO THEM AND ASK THEM IF THEY DID NOT WANT A MAN-SERVANT FOR HE COULD FIND PLEASURE ENOUGH IN SERVING THEM
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW THAT THEY ALL PITIED HER SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO HAVE HER OWN WAY
SUNBEAM MY DARLING--ONLY WAIT FOR ME A MOMENT BUT THE PHANTOM DID BUT FLY THE FASTER AND THE PRINCE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY IN THIS VAIN PURSUIT
AND A MONSTROUS GIANT WHO LIVED AT NO GREAT DISTANCE AND WHO WAS A VERY WICKED BEING RESOLVED TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THEM
SOON ALL THE LITTLE BOYS AND ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AT HOME HAD GONE OUT ATTRACTED BY THE MAGIC SOUNDS AND HAD RUSHED TO THE GREAT MARKET-PLACE
THE WIND WILL WHISTLE THROUGH MY DRESS AND THE BRAMBLES TEAR IT FROM MY BODY HOW DARE YOU CONTRADICT ME SAID HER STEPMOTHER
SHE WORKED AT HER OWN DAUGHTER'S HEAD AND FEET TILL SHE GOT THE THINGS FORCED ON
AGAIN CAME THE TWO SOLDIERS TO THE COTTAGE AND SEIZED THE GIRL CARRIED HER TO THE RIVER BANK TIED A STONE TO HER NECK AND FLUNG HER INTO THE WATER
HIS DAUGHTERS KISSED HIS HANDS WITH TEARS IN THEIR EYES AND WISHED HIM PROSPERITY AND HE GAVE THE ELDEST THE KEYS
ALL THIS WAS SOON TOLD TO THE KING UP AT THE PALACE AND WHEN HE HEARD WHAT SORROW THE WOMAN WAS IN AND THE REASON OF IT HE SAID THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD TAKE THE CHILD AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT SAVE IT
FOR THEY ALL LOVED HIM AND WOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM HIM
THE KING GLADLY GAVE HIS CONSENT
THEN SHE PUT ON A GORGEOUS ROBE OF LILAC SATIN LINED WITH BLUE AND A YELLOW PETTICOAT TRIMMED WITH VIOLET RIBBONS AND BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD THAT QUEENS ALWAYS RODE INTO THEIR NEW DOMINIONS SHE ORDERED A HORSE TO BE MADE READY FOR HER TO RIDE
HOW CAN YOU STILL DOUBT THAT I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART THEN HE GAVE THREE STROKES OF HIS WAND UPON THE BARREL AND ALL THE FEATHERS FLEW OUT IN A CLOUD AND SETTLED DOWN IN NEAT LITTLE SEPARATE HEAPS ALL ROUND THE ROOM
THE BEST THING THAT I CAN DO IS TO GO OUT AND BURY HIM JUST DO WHAT YOU THINK BEST FATHER SAID HIS WIFE
TAKE ME OUT TAKE ME OUT OR I SHALL BE BURNT TO A CINDER
TAKE ME OUT TAKE ME OUT OR I SHALL BE BURNT TO A CINDER
THE KING'S DAUGHTER SAID THAT SHE HAD GOT LEAVE TO GO TO CHURCH AND LISTEN TO THE PRIEST BUT THAT SHE HAD NO CLOTHES TO GO IN
WHAT AN UNHAPPY CREATURE I AM SHE CRIED TO BE SHUT UP IN THIS DISMAL TOWER AS IF I HAD COMMITTED SOME CRIME
THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS BOTTLE AND OILED THE HINGES WHEN THE GATE OPENED OF ITSELF AND HE SAW AN OLD CASTLE STANDING INSIDE
IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT PRINCE IVAN STOLE THE SORRY COLT SADDLED IT JUMPED ON ITS BACK AND GALLOPED AWAY TO THE FIERY RIVER
WHEN THE KING WAS INFORMED OF THIS HE FELL INTO A RAGE AND SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE RING LET HER HAVE INHERITED IT FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT
CANST THOU WIELD THAT SWORD ASKED THE FOAL
WHEN WE ENTER INTO THIS WOOD YOU MUST TAKE THE GREATEST CARE NOT TO TOUCH A LEAF OF IT OR ALL WILL BE OVER BOTH WITH ME AND WITH YOU FOR A TROLL WITH THREE HEADS WHO IS THE OWNER OF THE WOOD LIVES HERE SO SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD AND NOT TOUCH ANYTHING
SHE FED HIM WELL AND WHEN EVENING CAME PUT HIM BACK IN THE WARDROBE
WHAT IS YOUR NAME HE ASKED HER
BESIDES THIS SHE KEPT THE HOUSE IN ORDER TIDIED ALL THE ROOMS AND MADE HERSELF SO GENERALLY USEFUL THAT HER BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED AND THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER
AND NOW THE REAL WEDDING WAS HELD AND HELD IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS HEARD OF AND SPOKEN ABOUT ALL OVER SEVEN KINGDOMS
ROUND THE HOUSE SHE WENT IN SEARCH OF STEPS BUT COULD FIND NONE
WHEN HE SAW THAT SHE CAME EMPTY-HANDED HE GOT UP AND LEFT HER GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF
YOU MUST KNOW THAT SHE IS A CRUEL FAIRY WHO HATES ME AND AS SHE IS OLDER THAN I AM AND HAS MORE POWER I CAN DO NOTHING AGAINST HER
THERE WAS A LARGE HOUSE AND THE FIRE WAS BURNING SO BRIGHTLY INSIDE THAT HE COULD TELL THAT THE PEOPLE WERE NOT IN BED
THE PRINCESS LOST NO TIME IN OFFERING IT THE CARBUNCLE BOX WHICH IT GRASPED IN ITS TALONS AND INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED LEAVING IN ITS PLACE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PRINCE SHE HAD EVER SEEN WHO WAS SPLENDIDLY DRESSED AND WORE A DIAMOND CROWN
BUT TO SEE HER YOU MUST RISE EARLY.(17 17 CH
IT WAS RAPUNZEL IN HER LONELINESS TRYING TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME BY LETTING HER SWEET VOICE RING OUT INTO THE WOOD
AFTER A LONG LONG WHILE CAME KARI WOODENGOWN'S WICKED STEPMOTHER WITH HER DAUGHTER TOO AND THE SHOE FITTED HER
FOR THERE SHE WAS TO MEET THE TROLL AND RITTER RED WAS TO STAY WITH HER AND PROTECT HER
THEN THE EAGLE FLEW ON MUCH FARTHER WITH THE MAN BUT AT LENGTH IT ALIGHTED ON A STONE FOR A WHILE
THIS WENT ON ALL DAY BUT AS EVENING CAME ON THE HUNTSMEN HAD GRADUALLY ENCIRCLED THE ROE AND ONE OF THEM WOUNDED IT SLIGHTLY IN THE FOOT SO THAT IT LIMPED AND RAN OFF SLOWLY
THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND WERE VERY MERRY
BUT AS HIS FATHER WENT ON LAUGHING AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF STOPPING THE YOUNG MAN TOOK HIS HAND KISSED IT TENDERLY OPENED THE DOOR AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE WAS AS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE
WHEN HE HAD BREAKFASTED HE WENT OUT FOR A WALK
WELL THEN YOU MUST TAKE A DRINK OUT OF THAT BOTTLE WHICH IS HANGING BY ITS SIDE FOR THAT'S WHAT THE TROLL DOES WHENEVER HE GOES OUT AND WANTS TO USE THE SWORD SAID THE PRINCESS
FIND ME SOMETHING THAT IT WILL BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SHE SAID
THE YOUTH AT ONCE CONSENTED TO THIS AND ENTERED INTO THE KING'S SERVICE FOR HE THOUGHT HE COULD EASILY WATCH THE FOALS AND INFORM THE KING WHAT THEY ATE AND DRANK
HE GAVE ONE TO EACH OF THE SISTERS AND THEY TOOK THEM WITHOUT EVEN DEIGNING TO LOOK AT THE LAD EXCEPT LINA THE YOUNGEST WHO FIXED HER LARGE BLACK EYES AS SOFT AS VELVET ON HIM AND EXCLAIMED OH HOW PRETTY HE IS--OUR NEW FLOWER BOY THE REST ALL BURST OUT LAUGHING AND THE ELDEST POINTED OUT THAT A PRINCESS OUGHT NEVER TO LOWER HERSELF BY LOOKING AT A GARDEN BOY
SO THERE WAS GREAT GLADNESS IN THE PALACE BUT NO ONE WAS MORE GLAD THAN THE KING'S DAUGHTER
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING NOW SAID HE
BUT AS THE GOOSE GAVE NO SIGN OF APPEARING HE SENT HIS HEAD CARVER TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS THE MATTER IN THE KITCHEN
THERE THEY STOOD UP TO THEIR NECKS IN WATER
THEN HE SENT FOR A FAIRY WHO LIVED NEAR HIS KINGDOM AND AFTER RECEIVING HER WITH MORE POLITENESS THAN HE GENERALLY SHOWED AND ENTERTAINING HER AT A SUMPTUOUS FEAST HE TOOK HER UP TO SEE THE QUEEN
DEPEND UPON IT THOSE WHO DON'T LAUGH HAVE A BAD CONSCIENCE AT FIRST THE KING PAID NO HEED TO HER WORDS BUT THE OLD WOMAN HARPED SO LONG ON THE SUBJECT AND ACCUSED THE YOUNG QUEEN OF SO MANY BAD THINGS THAT AT LAST HE LET HIMSELF BE TALKED OVER AND CONDEMNED HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE TO DEATH
AT THE SIGHT OF THE HIDEOUS CREATURE HE ALMOST FELL BACKWARDS
WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE THE FLOWERS ALONE
WHATEVER HAPPENS DO NOT OPEN YOUR ORANGES TILL YOU REACH THE BANK OF A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN
NOT A SOUL IN THE HOUSE
MOTHER ANSWERED THE PRINCE I HAVE LOST MY SWEET SHEPHERDESS BUT I AM DETERMINED TO FIND HER AGAIN THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE TO TRAVERSE THE WHOLE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HER GO THAT WAY MY SON SAID THE OLD WOMAN POINTING TOWARDS THE PATH THAT LED TO THE CASTLE
QUACK
BUT AFTER ALL IT MUST HAVE BEEN ALL CARABOSSE'S FAULT
AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD WAS SITTING ON THE DOORSTEP ENJOYING THE FRESH AIR
YES REPLIED THE OTHER ELEVEN IN CHORUS AND THEY TOOK THEIR PLACES ONE BY ONE BEHIND HER
WHILE THE PARENTS WERE AT CHURCH A WONDERFUL MUSIC HAD RESOUNDED
THEN SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HER
LET US GO HOME SISTERS CRIES THE PRINCE
WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND BEGGED FOR A PLACE SAYING THAT HER NAME WAS KARI WOODENGOWN
SHALL I GO AND TELL THE KING OF THE PEACOCKS THAT YOU ARE HERE
SO PERCINET VERY UNWILLINGLY BROUGHT THE LITTLE SLEDGE WITH THE STAGS AND SHE MOUNTED BESIDE HIM
YES SAID THE BOY FOR HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A TRADE WHICH WOULD NOT TAKE LONG TO LEARN
WHEN NIGHT CAME HE SAW THE CASTLE BEFORE HIM ALL LIGHTED UP AND AS HE IMAGINED THAT THE PRINCESS MUST BE IN IT HE MADE HASTE TO GET THERE TOO
SO SHE THREW THEM AWAY AND WENT ON WITH BARE FEET NOT HEEDING THE BOGS NOR THE THORNS THAT WOUNDED HER NOR THE STONES THAT BRUISED HER
FATHER LAWRENCE
BUT SHE PUT DOWN HER HEAD CRYING
AT FIRST THEY DARED NOT GO NEAR IT NOT KNOWING WHAT IT MIGHT BE BUT BY-AND-BY IT REMAINED STATIONARY OVER SQUIRREL ISLAND FOR AS YOU HAVE GUESSED ALREADY THE LIGHT WAS THE GLOWING OF THE CARBUNCLE
SHE REFUSED TO EAT AND WOULD NOT PUT ON HER FINE CLOTHES NOR GO OUT WALKING AND DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN BECOME A LAUGHING-STOCK TO THE WORLD
WHO WOULD NOT BE VEXED ANSWERED SHE FOR THE KING INTENDS TO MARRY AGAIN AND HAS CHOSEN FOR HIS NEW BRIDE MY ENEMY THE HIDEOUS DUCHESS GRUMBLY OH WELL ANSWERED THE NURSE YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE A PRINCESS AND ARE EXPECTED TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE IN MAKING THE BEST OF WHATEVER HAPPENS
AT LAST SHE THREW IT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR CRYING
WHY WITH ALL MY HEART
BUT HE ANSWERED
A PRETTY JOKE INDEED
SHE WAS UNDER A SPELL SO THAT SHE MUST ALWAYS SLEEP IN A CASTLE SURROUNDED BY FLAMING FIRE
SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT SAY THAT HE WOULD MAKE THE ATTEMPT
AND THEN IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE HAD IT OPEN AND WAS ADMIRING THE TREASURES IT CONTAINED AS MUCH AS PRINCE PEERLESS HAD DONE BEFORE HER AND AT LAST SHE CAME TO THE CARBUNCLE BOX
GOOD DAY MY PRETTY ONE
I AM QUITE DONE ENOUGH SO SHE STEPPED UP QUICKLY TO THE OVEN AND TOOK OUT ALL THE LOAVES ONE AFTER THE OTHER
CONTINUE YOUR WORK SWEETHEART
HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO GOOD TO MORTALS THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS REPLIED THE SUN'S MOTHER
NO DEAR FRIEND DON'T CUT IT IS I SAID THE PRINCESS AGAIN
BUT NO SOONER DID THEY TOUCH THE CLERK THAN THEY STUCK ON TOO AND SO THERE WERE SEVEN OF THEM RUNNING AFTER DULLHEAD AND HIS GOOSE
THE ELDEST DAUGHTER OF THIS KING WILL MARRY A PRINCE FROM THE EAST THEN THE SECOND GIRL STEPPED FORWARD AND TURNING OVER THE PAGE SHE READ
JACK INSTANTLY BEGAN TO CLIMB AND WENT UP AND UP ON THE LADDER-LIKE BEAN TILL EVERYTHING HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM--THE COTTAGE THE VILLAGE AND EVEN THE TALL CHURCH TOWER--LOOKED QUITE LITTLE AND STILL HE COULD NOT SEE THE TOP OF THE BEANSTALK
NOW I WILL BRING YOU LUCK BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KIND HEART AND ARE WILLING TO SHARE WHAT YOU HAVE WITH OTHERS
PRINCE IVAN HAS A HORSE NOW WHICH IS BETTER THAN I WELL I CAN'T STAND IT SAYS KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS
THE FIRST NIGHT A TROLL CAME WITH THREE HEADS AND THREE RODS AND BEAT THE LAD MOST UNMERCIFULLY
NO SOONER HAD MINNIKIN GOT DOWN TO THE STRAND THAN THE TROLL CAME RUSHING ALONG WITH A GREAT WHISTLING AND WHIRRING AND HE WAS TWICE AS BIG AS THE FIRST TROLL AND HE HAD TEN HEADS
SHE POSSESSED A MAGIC MIRROR AND WHEN SHE USED TO STAND BEFORE IT GAZING AT HER OWN REFLECTION AND ASK
DO YOU THINK THAT I WILL HAVE A TOWEL THAT HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY YOUR DIRTY FINGERS AFTER THAT THE PRINCE WENT TO CHURCH AND KARI ALSO ASKED LEAVE TO GO
WELL TO-MORROW WE WILL MAKE HER A MUFF OF YOUR SKIN AND YOU YOURSELF SHALL BE CRUNCHED FOR WE WILL GIVE YOUR CARCASS TO THE DOGS THEREUPON THE GRANDMOTHER HASTENED TO DRESS POOR BLANCHETTE WHO WAS STILL TREMBLING WITH FEAR IN THE BED
THROUGH FORESTS WITH TREES WHOSE STEMS WERE AS THICK AS BEER-BARRELS
FOR A LONG TIME THE KING WENT SORROWING FOR HIS WIFE FOR HE HAD LOVED HER EXCEEDINGLY
NO INDEED YOU CAN'T SAID HIS FATHER
SO WHEN AS WAS THE USAGE AND CUSTOM ALL WERE TO DRINK TO THE BRIDE AND THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE PRESENT THE CUP-BEARER FILLED THE CUP FOR EACH IN TURN BOTH BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM AND KNIGHTS AND SERVANTS AND AT LAST AFTER A VERY LONG TIME HE CAME TO HALVOR
AND NOW WE WILL GO TO THE KING'S PALACE SAID DAPPLEGRIM--THAT WAS THE HORSE'S NAME BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT YOU MUST ASK THE KING FOR A GOOD STABLE AND EXCELLENT FODDER FOR ME SO THE LAD PROMISED NOT TO FORGET TO DO THAT
IF YOU DON'T BRING IT BACK FULL YOUR BONES SHALL SUFFER FOR IT XI TITTY WENT OFF RUBBING HER SIDES
THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCESS FEARED THAT THINGS WOULD NOT GO WELL WITH HER FOR THE SUN HAD NOTICED THAT SOME ONE FROM THE OTHER WORLD HAD BEEN IN THE PALACE
I AM CALLED DELICIA IF IT PLEASE YOU SHE ANSWERED
BUT THEY DID NOT SAY THAT THEY WERE IN PRISON FOR FEAR OF MAKING HER UNEASY
HALVOR THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE MANAGED AND WANTED TO SET OFF IMMEDIATELY
SO YOU MAY EASILY IMAGINE WHAT GRIEF AND DISTRESS WE ARE IN HERE SO WHEN THURSDAY EVENING CAME RITTER RED ACCOMPANIED THE PRINCESS TO THE SEA-SHORE
THEY ALSO SENT A CASKET OF JEWELS SO SPLENDID THAT NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND THE QUEEN WAS PERFECTLY DAZZLED WHEN SHE OPENED IT
HE SAT DOWN AND DINED AND THEN WENT INTO A BEDROOM
FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE KING'S PALACE MANY PERSONS HAD SEEN MINNIKIN COME SAILING THITHER AND HAD STOOD TO WATCH HIM
WELL IT'S VERY EVIDENT THAT I HAVE LOST NOTHING BY LETTING YOU SUCK ALL MY MARES SAID THE LAD TO THE YEARLING
HE BROKE THE WHEEL INTO A THOUSAND PIECES AND THEN FELL FAINTING ON THE GROUND
WHAT ARE YOU SPINNING HE ASKED IN A ROUGH VOICE
SO SO SAID THE WITCH TO HERSELF
WE WILL BOIL THE ELDEST-LOOKING OF THESE YOUNG MEN FIRST SAID HE AND SO ON TO THE LAST WHICH WILL BE THIS OLD CHAMPION WITH THE BLACK CAP
HE WEPT AND HE RAGED BUT AT LAST HE TOOK COMFORT AND TOLD HIMSELF THAT THE BEST THING TO DO WAS TO GO HOME AND TAKE THE THIRD OX WITHOUT LETTING HIS WIFE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEN TRY TO SELL IT SO WELL THAT HE GOT A GOOD SUM OF MONEY FOR IT
SCENTEST THOU SOME ILL THE STEED REPLIED
WHEREVER YOU LIKE SIRE SHE ANSWERED BUT I WILL NEVER MARRY ANY ONE ELSE AFTER THIS THEY TOOK ROSETTE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CASTLE AND THE PEACOCK WAS BROUGHT WITH HER AND TOLD TO WALK ABOUT ON THE TERRACE OUTSIDE HER WINDOWS SO THAT SHE MIGHT ALWAYS SEE HIM AND THEN THE LADIES OF THE COURT CAME TO SEE THE PRINCESS AND THEY BROUGHT HER BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS--DRESSES AND RIBBONS AND SWEETMEATS DIAMONDS AND PEARLS AND DOLLS AND EMBROIDERED SLIPPERS AND SHE WAS SO WELL BROUGHT UP AND SAID THANK YOU SO PRETTILY AND WAS SO GRACIOUS THAT EVERYONE WENT AWAY DELIGHTED WITH HER
WHO'S BEEN EATING MY LITTLE LOAF THE THIRD SAID
YOU HAVE COME THE LONGEST WAY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SAID THE KING
BUT IF YOU DON'T--WHY THEN YOU MUSTN'T BE ANNOYED AT FINDING YOUR HEAD STUCK ON TOP OF THE LAST POLE UP THERE PRINCE IVAN AGREED TO THESE TERMS
BUT RITTER RED SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THAT THEY HAD MUCH REASON TO BE AFRAID--HE HAD DELIVERED THE KING'S DAUGHTER FROM TWO TROLLS SO HE COULD EASILY DELIVER HER FROM THE THIRD AS WELL
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING SHE CRIED SUDDENLY
YES SAID THE FOAL WE SHALL GO INTO THAT WHEN THE FOALS GOT INTO THE CHURCHYARD THEY TURNED INTO MEN AND LOOKED LIKE THE SONS OF A KING AND THEIR CLOTHES WERE SO MAGNIFICENT THAT THEY SHONE WITH SPLENDOUR AND THEY WENT INTO THE CHURCH AND RECEIVED BREAD AND WINE FROM THE PRIEST WHO WAS STANDING BEFORE THE ALTAR AND CINDERLAD WENT IN TOO
SCENTEST THOU SOME ILL PRINCE IVAN HAS COME AND CARRIED OFF MARYA MOREVNA IS IT POSSIBLE TO CATCH THEM IT IS POSSIBLE TO SOW BARLEY TO WAIT TILL IT GROWS UP TO REAP IT AND THRESH IT TO BREW BEER TO DRINK OURSELVES DRUNK ON IT TO SLEEP OUR FILL AND THEN TO SET OFF IN PURSUIT--AND YET TO BE IN TIME KOSHCHEI GALLOPED OFF CAUGHT UP PRINCE IVAN
SO HE WENT ON TO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WHO LIVED IN A GOLDEN PALACE
IN FACT I DON'T THINK I SHALL EVER LOVE ANYONE CRIED THE PRINCESS
CANNOT WE JOURNEY TOGETHER I SEEMED TO HEAR A VOICE IN THE AIR WHICH SAID
THEN SHE BEGAN TO RUN OVER THE SHARP STONES AND THROUGH THE BRAMBLE BUSHES AND THE WILD BEASTS RAN PAST HER BUT THEY DID HER NO HARM
IF THE TWO OTHERS ARE STILL HANGING THERE IT IS TRUE BUT IF THEY ARE NOT IT'S NOTHING ELSE BUT WITCHCRAFT SO HE TIED UP HIS OX AND RAN BACK TO SEE IF THEY REALLY WERE HANGING THERE
SO CATCH ME GIVING YOU ANY WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED EATING THEY SAID
THEN SHE WAS FORCED TO DEPART BUT AS SHE WENT SHE SAID
THERE WAS NOT MUCH MORE ROOM BUT BY CLOSING UP A BIT THEY MANAGED
ONE DAY AS THE PRINCE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE GREAT GALLERY THINKING HOW MISERABLE IT WAS TO BE SO UGLY AND TO BE FORCED TO MARRY AN EQUALLY FRIGHTFUL PRINCESS HE LOOKED UP SUDDENLY AND NOTICED THAT THE PAINTED WINDOWS WERE PARTICULARLY BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AND FOR THE SAKE OF DOING SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS SAD THOUGHTS HE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THEM ATTENTIVELY
YES AND IF HE HAD NINE ADDED TO THE NINE AND THEN NINE MORE STILL I WOULD NOT GO AWAY SAID HALVOR AND WENT AND STOOD BY THE STOVE
I FOR ONE SHALL BE QUITE SATISFIED IF SHE IS
WHEN HALVOR HAD STOOD THERE FOR SOME TIME AND NO ONE HAD COME OUT HE WENT IN AND OPENED A DOOR AND INSIDE A PRINCESS WAS SITTING AT HER WHEEL SPINNING
BEFORE THE BULL WENT INTO THE WOOD HE SAID TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER
AND THE WIND BORE IT BLAZING OUT TO SEA FLAMING INTO THE DARK
IT IS SHE I AM SEEKING WHY SHOULD I LAUGH ASKED THE OLD MAN
WILL YOU WAGER YOUR THIMBLE AND YOUR GOLDEN NEEDLE THAT I AM BRINGING YOU THE BEST NEWS YOU COULD POSSIBLY HEAR ALAS SIGHED THE QUEEN SINCE THE DEATH OF THE JOLLY KING AND THE LOSS OF MY DELICIA ALL THE NEWS IN THE WORLD IS NOT WORTH A PIN TO ME
BUT HIS MOTHER HAD SOOTHED HIM WITH SOFT WORDS ASSURING HIM THAT THIS WAS NOT SO
THE QUEEN MUST DO AS SHE PLEASES
THEY CHATTERED MUCH ABOUT MANY THINGS AND TOLD HALVOR OF THIS AND OF THAT AND AT LAST HE ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD NEVER HAD ANY CHILD
GIVE ME THE COFFIN
THE ROSES WERE CRIMSON DIAMONDS WITH EMERALD LEAVES
COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR FOR YOU THE LAD WAS WILLING ENOUGH SO HE SAT DOWN IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BESIDE THE OLD HAG AND LAID HIS HEAD ON HER KNEES AND SHE COMBED HIS HAIR ALL DAY WHILE HE LAY THERE AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO IDLENESS
SO HE WENT OFF TO THE FOREST AND ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE HAD CUT DOWN THE TREE HE SAW A MAN SITTING WITH A MOST DISMAL EXPRESSION OF FACE
I KNEW VERY WELL ON THE FIRST SIGHT OF ME THAT COULD BE GOT I WOULD BE SHOT LIKE A DOG
VERY SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER THE YOUTH LET SLIP THE THIRD HARE AND IT SET OFF AND RAN ROUND AND ROUND THE COURTYARD
I AM COMING AND SHE BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND THE ROOM FOR HER FUR COAT BUT HER HUSBAND JUMPED UP AND TAKING FIRM HOLD OF HER BY THE HAND HELD HER FAST AND REPROACHED HER SAYING
THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE BUT HALVOR THOUGHT THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN ENOUGH YET AND THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO WALK ABOUT A LITTLE LONGER TO TRY IF HE COULD NOT MEET SOMEBODY
THIS ACCUSATION WAS READ TO THE PRISONERS WHO CRIED OUT THAT THEY HAD SPOKEN THE TRUTH THAT THEIR SISTER WAS INDEED A PRINCESS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE DAY AND THAT THERE WAS SOME MYSTERY ABOUT ALL THIS WHICH THEY COULD NOT FATHOM
SO HE CAME TO HIMSELF AGAIN BUT HE HAD TO LIE THERE FOR THREE WEEKS AND REST BEFORE HE WAS IN A STATE TO MOVE
AND AFTER THE KING'S DEATH DULLHEAD SUCCEEDED TO THE KINGDOM AND LIVED HAPPILY WITH HIS WIFE FOR MANY YEARS AFTER.(30 30 GRIMM
THEN THE OLD WOMAN SAID THAT IT WAS TO GUIDE THE MAN TO HIM
NO ANSWER
AND YOU WILL SEE IN THE MORNING HE WILL NOT HAVE CHANGED BACK INTO A PIG BUT WILL STILL BE A MAN
WHAT IS YOUR NAME MY LITTLE ONE SAID SHE
AND WHEN IT SNORED THE WATER WAS AGITATED FOR SEVEN MILES AROUND
WE OTHERS WILL GO OUT AND FETCH FOOD SO THEY WENT FORTH INTO THE WOOD AND SHOT HARES AND ROE-DEER BIRDS AND WOOD-PIGEONS AND ANY OTHER GAME THEY CAME ACROSS
EVERY TREE SEEMED TO BE SENDING OUT A SOFT RADIANCE WHICH WAS CLEARER THAN MOONLIGHT AND SOFTER THAN DAYLIGHT AND AT THE END OF A LONG AVENUE OF TREES OPPOSITE TO HER THE PRINCESS SAW A PALACE OF CLEAR CRYSTAL WHICH BLAZED LIKE THE SUN
THEN THE FAIRY THREW HER ARMS ROUND THE PRINCESS'S NECK AND NEARLY SMOTHERED HER WITH KISSES SAYING
SHE GOT THAT FOR THE CHURCH WAS VERY NEAR
AY AY YOUR OWN WIFE IS NOT AT HOME SAID THE WIDOW WOMAN
SHE HAD TO BEAR THAT BUT THEN SHE ASKED PERMISSION TO GO TO CHURCH
IF YOU FIND FAVOUR IN THE EYES OF THE PRINCESS OLGA THEN LET HER MARRY YOU
HAPPILY HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS STILL ONE REMAINING FRIEND AND HE CRIED WITH DYING ACCENTS
IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM TO DO HE SAID HE WOULD FETCH WOOD AND WATER FOR THE KITCHEN-MAID AND THAT HE OBTAINED LEAVE TO DO
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR HE ARRIVED AT THE WALL WHICH WAS VERY HIGH INDEED
OH KING
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SHE SAID THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD BE HALF AS HANDSOME AND DELIGHTFUL
THE PRINCESS WAS SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
WE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL DAYS QUITE ALONE AND THERE IS NO CORNER OF THE GARDEN THAT WE HAVE NOT EXPLORED
DON'T BE VEXED WITH ME PERCINET SHE SAID
IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW I AM SUFFERING FOR MY WANT OF TRUST IN YOU
WHEN THEY WERE ASKED WHAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING ALL NIGHT THEY ALWAYS ANSWERED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ASLEEP
AS KING GRUMPY WAS NOT USED TO BEING CONTRADICTED IN ANYTHING HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED WITH HIS SON AND ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN THE TOWER THAT WAS KEPT ON PURPOSE FOR REBELLIOUS PRINCES BUT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS BECAUSE THERE HAD NOT BEEN ANY
IN HIS HAND HE CARRIED A WHIP MADE OF TWENTY LONG SNAKES ALL ALIVE AND WRITHING AND THE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIFIED AT THE SIGHT THAT SHE HEARTILY WISHED SHE HAD NEVER COME
YOU WILL HAVE TO LET ME HAVE YOUR NIGHT-GOWN TOO HE SAID FOR I BEGIN TO SEE THAT THE SHEET WON'T BE ENOUGH THEN SHE GAVE HIM HER NIGHT-GOWN BUT JUST THEN IT CAME INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO LOCK THE DOOR AND HE WAS FORCED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND DO IT BEFORE HE COULD LIE DOWN IN BED AGAIN
WELL LITTLE FRIGHT LITTLE TOAD
I CAN'T AND WON'T LET YOU OUT THEN I SHALL DIE OF GRIEF REPLIED THE ROE FOR WHEN I HEAR THAT HORN I FEEL AS IF I MUST JUMP RIGHT OUT OF MY SKIN SO AT LAST WHEN SISTER FOUND THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE SHE OPENED THE DOOR WITH A HEAVY HEART AND THE ROE DARTED FORTH FULL OF GLEE AND HEALTH INTO THE FOREST
I AM TOLD THAT A GREAT TREASURE LIES UNDER THAT STONE
DO YOU SEE THIS SKEIN
MEANWHILE THE QUEEN HAD SENT FOR AN OLD FAIRY AS MALICIOUS AS HERSELF AND SAID TO HER
ROSETTE THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO PRETTY
SHUT THE DOOR WELL MY LITTLE LAMB
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF RENELDE'S GRANDMOTHER AND WAS MORE THAN NINETY YEARS OLD
GO IN PEACE AND MAY HEAVEN GIVE YOU A GLORIOUS VICTORY WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR HIS DEPARTURE THE KING GAVE THEM THE KEYS OF ALL THE ROOMS AND REMINDED THEM ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD SAID
THE RATCATCHER A VERY LONG TIME AGO THE TOWN OF HAMEL IN GERMANY WAS INVADED BY BANDS OF RATS THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE NOR WILL EVER BE AGAIN
THE OTHER WHO HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN HASTE ONE FOOT SHOD THE OTHER BARE HAD HURT HIMSELF AGAINST A BIG STONE AND COULD NOT WALK WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
TAKE YOU THE CHILD
HE BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD TELL HIM ALL HER HISTORY AS SHE MIGHT SAFELY TRUST HIM
HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THEY CALL ME UGLY
OF THE HUNTSMEN HE COULD NOT REST ANOTHER MOMENT AND SAID
THERE HE BEGAN TO CUT DOWN A TREE BUT BEFORE LONG HE MADE A FALSE STROKE WITH HIS AXE AND CUT HIS OWN ARM SO BADLY THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GO HOME AND HAVE IT BOUND UP
IN FACT THERE WAS NO END TO THEM
NOW THE ONLY TROUBLE THAT LORD TUBBY HAD WAS ABOUT HIS SON WHOM HE LOVED VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT IN THE LEAST ALIKE FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE WAS AS THIN AS A CUCKOO
HERE HE FOUND A WOMAN ROCKING A CHILD
SHE WAS TOO UGLY AND RAGGED FOR HIM EVER TO HAVE NOTICED HER BUT TITTY ON HER SIDE HAD ADMIRED HIM THOUGH SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A LITTLE FATTER
AND WHEN THE PRINCE CAME TO THE BLUE SEA HE LOOKED--THERE SLEPT THE NORKA ON A STONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA
SO HE TOLD THE KING'S DAUGHTER TO TAKE THE HORN OF OINTMENT THAT WAS HANGING AT THE TROLL'S BELT AND ANOINT HIM WITH IT
SHE NEITHER SPAT NOR DID ANYTHING ELSE BUT STILL THE WITCH CHANGED HER INTO A REINDEER AND SMUGGLED HER OWN DAUGHTER INTO HER PLACE AS THE PRINCE'S WIFE
FOR THE MOMENT HE GOT OUT OF IT IT ONCE MORE BECAME AS SMALL AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN HE GOT IT FROM THE OLD WOMAN AND THOSE WHO CAME FROM THE KING'S PALACE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A RAGGED LITTLE BOY WHO WAS STANDING DOWN BY THE SEA-SHORE
WE CAN GIVE YOU NO SUCH ACCOMMODATION THEY SAID FOR WE HAVE NONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDFUL WHEN A GREAT LORD LIKE YOU IS TO BE ENTERTAINED
PAR MME
WE HAVE A PAIR OF OLD BOOTS HERE WITH WHICH YOU CAN GO FIFTEEN QUARTERS OF A MILE AT EACH STEP
THE FALCON SPRINKLED IT WITH THE WATER OF LIFE--PRINCE IVAN SHUDDERED STOOD UP AND SAID
I WONDER IF YOU GUESSED THEN THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENED I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART AND WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU LIKE PRINCE PERCINET JOYFULLY TOOK THE HAND THAT WAS GIVEN HIM AND FOR FEAR THE PRINCESS SHOULD CHANGE HER MIND THE WEDDING WAS HELD AT ONCE WITH THE GREATEST SPLENDOUR AND GRACIOSA AND PERCINET LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.(11 11 GRACIEUSE ET PERCINET
AT THAT VERY TIME THE SILVER ARTICLES TURNED BLACK WHICH PRINCE IVAN HAD LEFT WITH HIS BROTHERS-IN-LAW
SHE WENT TO THE ROCK AND KNOCKED WHEREUPON OUT CAME THE MAN AND GAVE HER A GOWN WHICH WAS MUCH MORE MAGNIFICENT THAN THE FIRST
THEIR HARNESS WAS ALL OF CRIMSON VELVET WITH GOLD BUCKLES AND BEHIND THE CARRIAGE WALKED SIXTY BEAUTIFUL LADIES CHOSEN BY THE KING TO WAIT UPON ROSETTE AND AMUSE HER
NOW THE LANDLORD OF THE INN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS AND WHEN THEY SAW THE GOOSE THEY WERE FILLED WITH CURIOSITY AS TO WHAT THIS WONDERFUL BIRD COULD BE AND EACH LONGED TO HAVE ONE OF ITS GOLDEN FEATHERS
HER OWN DAUGHTER WHO WAS AS HIDEOUS AS NIGHT AND HAD ONLY ONE EYE REPROACHED HER BY SAYING IT IS I WHO OUGHT TO HAVE HAD THIS GOOD LUCK AND BEEN QUEEN BE QUIET WILL YOU SAID THE OLD WOMAN
YOU ARE BEING TREATED LIKE A PRINCE DON'T BE AFRAID REPLIED THE STAR GAZER GENTLY
OUR SISTER IS HERE AND HE LIFTED UP THE TUB AND THE PRINCESS STEPPED FORWARD WITH HER ROYAL ROBES AND WITH THE GOLDEN STAR ON HER FOREHEAD LOOKING SO LOVELY AND SWEET AND CHARMING THAT THEY ALL FELL IN LOVE WITH HER ON THE SPOT
IN THE MEANTIME THE PRINCESS CABBAGE-STALK HAD REACHED THE PALACE TRAVELLING IN A LITTER
SHE WAS SO THIN THAT THE LIGHT SHONE THROUGH HER AND HER EYES GLOWED LIKE LAMPS
THE POOR GIRL LOVED HIM WITH HER WHOLE SOUL AND SHE WAS MORE UNHAPPY THAN SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE WHEN BURCHARD WAS ONLY TORMENTING HER BODY
SO SHE SEIZED HIM BY THE HAND AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE HALL AND SAID TO THE KING
AND THE CURSE SOON CAME UPON ALL OF THEM
MAMMA
IMMEDIATELY THEY COCKED UP THEIR TAILS DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND FLED INTO THE BLUE SEA
BUT BEFORE HE COULD ASK THE YOUTH IF HE HEARD ANYTHING THERE WAS SUCH A NEIGHING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEATH THAT THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT HILLS AND ROCKS WOULD BE RENT IN PIECES
ON THE EVENING OF THE WEDDING-DAY ALL THE LARDERS CELLARS CUPBOARDS AND TABLES OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER RICH OR POOR WERE LOADED AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT WITH BREAD WINE BEER CAKES AND TARTS ROAST LARKS AND EVEN GEESE SO THAT TUBBY COULD NOT COMPLAIN ANY MORE THAT HIS SON HAD MARRIED FAMINE
SO CINDERLAD PULLED OUT THE CONSECRATED BREAD AND THE FLASK OF WINE AND SHOWED THEM TO THE KING
THEN SHE TAPPED THE NEXT CASK AND OUT CAME A BUSHEL OF GOLD PIECES
THE TREES GREW VERY FAST AND WHEN THEY WERE AS TALL AS A GIRL OF FIFTEEN HE SAID TO THE CHERRY LAUREL MY LOVELY CHERRY LAUREL WITH THE GOLDEN RAKE I HAVE RAKED THEE WITH THE GOLDEN BUCKET I HAVE WATERED THEE WITH THE SILKEN TOWEL I HAVE WIPED THEE
THEY TOOK OUT OF THEM THE MOST MAGNIFICENT DRESSES WHICH THEY PUT ON BEFORE THEIR MIRRORS AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED TURNED THEMSELVES ALL ROUND TO ADMIRE THEIR APPEARANCES
FIE MADAM
THE NOISE HE MADE BROUGHT HIS GUARDS TO HIS AID AND AS SOON AS HE REVIVED THEY ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER
THEY GAVE HIM THE MOST EXQUISITE DISHES TO EAT AND THE MOST DELICATE WINES TO DRINK
THE FORMER YOUTHS HAD BEEN HANDSOME BUT THIS ONE WAS HANDSOMER STILL
WHEN HE SAW ROSETTE'S BROTHERS HE KNEW AT ONCE THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND STOPPING HIS CARRIAGE HE SENT FOR THEM TO SPEAK TO HIM
BUT UNLUCKILY THE RICH DRESS AND JEWELS ONLY MADE TITTY LOOK UGLIER STILL AND DESIRE COULD NOT HELP FEELING HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN HE MADE HIS ENTRY WITH HER INTO THE CITY
NEXT THURSDAY EVENING ALL WENT JUST THE SAME AND EVERYONE WAS FULL OF GRIEF AND AFFLICTION BUT RITTER RED SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER THE KING'S DAUGHTER FROM ONE TROLL SO THAT HE COULD VERY EASILY DELIVER HER FROM ANOTHER AND HE LED HER DOWN TO THE SEA-SHORE
AS HE WAS A HUNDRED TIMES HANDSOMER AND BRAVER THAN THE AMBASSADOR THE PRINCESS FOUND SHE COULD LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
THE MAN CALLED THE FISH TOGETHER WITH HIS HORN BUT NONE OF THEM KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
RECKON LET US RECKON THE HEADS FIRST
GO AND GATHER THEM AND SPIN THEM INTO TWO FINE SHIFTS
THE MARE PULLED IT A LITTLE FORWARD AND THEN A LITTLE BACK AND THEN IT STOPPED QUITE SHORT
NOW KOSHCHEI THE DEATHLESS HAPPENED NOT TO BE AT HOME
LET HIM BE ALIVE OR LET HIM BE DEAD I'LL GRIND HIS BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD NONSENSE SAID THE WIFE IT IS ONLY A ROASTED BULLOCK THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE A TIT-BIT FOR YOUR SUPPER
HE WAS DRESSED IN GREEN AND THE CAP WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND WAS ADORNED WITH WHITE PLUMES
OUT OF IT FLEW A LITTLE CANARY JUST LIKE THE OTHERS WHO CRIED
SHE SHALL HAVE WHATEVER SHE LIKES AND I SHALL LOVE HER DEARLY
WHEN DID IT EVER HAPPEN THAT A KING'S DAUGHTER MARRIED A PIG WHAT A BABY YOU ARE SAID THE OTHER SISTER
WHATEVER DID YE COME HOME FOR HOW COULD WE HELP COMING HOME SAID THEY
HE CAUGHT HER BY THE FUR COAT AND BEGGED AND IMPLORED HER NOT TO GO FOR IF SHE DID SHE WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER RETURN
THE KING WAS SO DISTRESSED WHEN HE HEARD IT THAT HE WAS ALMOST OVERCOME BY GRIEF
BUT TELL ME CHILD HOW CAME YOU HERE AND HOW IS IT YOU HAVE NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER NOR FRIEND A FAIRY CALLED CANCALINE IS THE CAUSE OF MY BEING HERE ANSWERED SHE FOR WHILE I LIVED WITH HER I GOT NOTHING BUT BLOWS AND HARSH WORDS UNTIL AT LAST I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND RAN AWAY FROM HER WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I WAS GOING AND AS I CAME THROUGH A WOOD THE WICKED PRINCE MET ME AND OFFERED TO GIVE ME CHARGE OF THE POULTRY-YARD
